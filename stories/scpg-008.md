# SCPG-008: The Last Gorgon

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-006 is housed in a specialized humanoid containment chamber at Site-██, constructed entirely from polished obsidian and equipped with an advanced mirror array system. The chamber measures 8m x 8m x 4m and is maintained at a constant temperature of 18°C with 60% humidity to prevent deterioration of SCPG-006's serpentine appendages.

All observation of SCPG-006 must be conducted exclusively through the mirror system or via thermal imaging equipment. Under no circumstances are personnel to make direct visual contact with SCPG-006. Personnel assigned to SCPG-006 must undergo mandatory vision impairment training and are required to wear specialized blindfolds equipped with audio-navigation systems when entering the containment area.

SCPG-006 is to be provided with live prey (typically rabbits or small mammals) twice weekly. These feeding sessions are automated and monitored remotely. Any personnel who become petrified due to accidental exposure to SCPG-006 are to be catalogued as SCPG-006-1 instances and maintained in Site-██'s Statue Garden for potential future restoration research.

**Description:** SCPG-006 appears to be a humanoid female entity approximately 1.7 meters in height, consistent with classical depictions of the mythological Medusa. Her hair consists of approximately 200-300 living serpents, each measuring between 30-60 cm in length. The serpents display typical defensive behaviors and have been observed to react independently to stimuli, though they appear to share some form of collective consciousness with SCPG-006.

SCPG-006's primary anomalous property is immediate petrification of any living organism that makes direct eye contact with her. The petrification process occurs within 0.3 seconds of visual contact and appears to convert organic matter into a marble-like substance while preserving perfect anatomical detail. Affected subjects (SCPG-006-1) retain awareness for approximately 15-20 seconds post-petrification before complete neural cessation occurs.

Unlike traditional mythological accounts, SCPG-006 demonstrates significant intelligence and emotional complexity. She is capable of speech in ancient Greek, Latin, and has shown remarkable aptitude for learning modern languages. SCPG-006 expresses deep remorse regarding her condition and has been cooperative with Foundation personnel, often warning them when they risk accidental eye contact.

SCPG-006 claims to be the last surviving member of the three Gorgon sisters from Greek mythology, stating that her sisters Stheno and Euryale "faded when mortals stopped believing." She demonstrates extensive knowledge of historical events spanning over 3,000 years and has provided valuable insight into several other mythological SCPs in Foundation custody.

**Addendum 006-1: Initial Interview**
The following is an excerpt from SCPG-006's first formal interview, conducted by Dr. Helena Vasquez via mirror communication on ██/██/20██:

**Dr. Vasquez:** Can you tell us your name?

**SCPG-006:** I was called Medusa, though that was more title than name. "Guardian" in your tongue. I guarded the threshold between worlds, between mortal and divine. Now I guard nothing but sorrow.

**Dr. Vasquez:** How long have you been aware of your current situation?

**SCPG-006:** Time moves strangely for one cursed as I am. I remember Perseus... his mirror shield. The pain of my death, and then... awakening in your modern world. Decades? Perhaps a century? The memories blur like water.

**Dr. Vasquez:** You mentioned your sisters. What happened to them?

**SCPG-006:** [Long pause] We were bound to the old ways, fed by fear and worship. When the last temples fell, when the last prayers faded... Stheno simply closed her eyes one morning and became stone herself. Euryale... she walked into the sea. Only I remain, sustained by something else now. By guilt, perhaps.

**Addendum 006-2: Incident 006-Alpha**
On ██/██/20██, D-Class personnel D-9847 accidentally damaged his blindfold system during routine maintenance, resulting in partial eye contact with SCPG-006. The subject's right arm and shoulder were instantly petrified while the rest of his body remained unaffected. SCPG-006 immediately began vocalizing distress in ancient Greek before switching to English:

"No, no! I tried to look away! Young man, forgive me! Please, someone help him!"

Medical analysis revealed that the petrified tissue maintained its original molecular structure but had been transmuted into a calcium carbonate matrix. D-9847 survived the incident but required amputation of the affected limb. SCPG-006 refused feeding for three weeks following this incident and repeatedly requested to speak with the injured subject to apologize personally.

**Addendum 006-3: Project MIRROR SHIELD**
Following SCPG-006's cooperative behavior and apparent genuine distress over harmful incidents, Dr. Vasquez proposed Project MIRROR SHIELD - an experimental procedure to create reflective contact lenses that might allow SCPG-006 limited safe visual interaction with personnel. The proposal was initially rejected due to security concerns but has been reconsidered following SCPG-006's provision of critical intelligence regarding SCP-████.

**Addendum 006-4: Recovery Log**
SCPG-006 was discovered in the basement of an abandoned museum in Athens, Greece, on ██/██/20██. Local authorities had reported a series of "vandalism incidents" where marble statues were appearing overnight in the museum's vicinity. Investigation revealed these to be petrified homeless individuals who had taken shelter in the building.

SCPG-006 was found in a state of severe psychological distress, surrounded by 23 petrified individuals arranged in what appeared to be a protective circle around her. She claimed to have been trying to prevent accidental contact by "making walls of the already lost." Mobile Task Force Mu-13 ("Ghostbusters") successfully contained SCPG-006 using a combination of mirrors and sedatives. The petrified individuals were relocated to Site-██ as SCPG-006-1 instances.

**Addendum 006-5: Psychological Profile**
Dr. Vasquez's ongoing psychological evaluation of SCPG-006 reveals an entity suffering from severe trauma and survivor's guilt spanning millennia. SCPG-006 frequently expresses desire for "true death" but demonstrates strong self-preservation instincts. She has shown genuine care for Foundation personnel and has on multiple occasions warned staff of potential safety hazards before they were identified by security systems.

SCPG-006 displays particular interest in art and literature, often requesting books and music. She has demonstrated ability to create sculptures by directing petrified subjects before complete neural cessation, though she refuses to do so, calling it "an abomination of my curse."

**Research Notes - Dr. Helena Vasquez:**
SCPG-006 represents perhaps our most cooperative Keter-class entity. Her knowledge of ancient anomalous phenomena is invaluable, and her genuine desire to minimize harm makes her unique among mythological SCPs. However, we must not forget that her very existence is a constant threat. One moment of carelessness, one mirror out of place, and we add another statue to our growing collection.

The tragedy of SCPG-006 is not just her curse, but her awareness of it. She is perhaps the loneliest being in our custody - immortal, isolated, and carrying the weight of every life her gaze has claimed. Whether this makes her more dangerous or less remains to be seen.

**Current Status:** SCPG-006 remains in containment at Site-██. Project MIRROR SHIELD is under review. Dr. Vasquez continues weekly psychological sessions via mirror communication. SCPG-006 has recently begun composing poetry in ancient Greek, which linguistic analysis suggests contains previously unknown mythological references. Translation and analysis are ongoing.
