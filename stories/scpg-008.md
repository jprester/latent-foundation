# SCPG-008: The Confluence of the Thirteenth Hour

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-008 cannot be contained in any conventional sense, as it represents an ongoing multidimensional convergence event rather than a discrete entity or object. The Foundation's primary objective is the prevention of SCPG-008-Omega, the projected culmination point of all SCPG-008-related activities.

Mobile Task Force Psi-13 ("Void Watchers") maintains a global surveillance network monitoring for SCPG-008-Alpha manifestations (see Description). All suspected instances of the Thirteenth Hour Confluence are to be reported immediately to Site-01 Command. Upon confirmation of SCPG-008-Alpha activity, MTF Psi-13 is authorized to deploy Counter-Ritual Protocol Sisyphus, involving targeted elimination of cult members and immediate destruction of ritual sites using thermite charges and Class-VII memetic kill agents.

Foundation assets embedded within major astronomical organizations monitor for stellar alignment patterns matching the "Stellae Mortis" configuration described in recovered cult documentation. Early warning systems have been established at seventeen (17) locations worldwide where geological conditions align with SCPG-008 manifestation requirements.

Due to the temporal nature of SCPG-008, all personnel assigned to the project undergo daily chronometer synchronization and are equipped with quantum-entangled timepieces to detect temporal anomalies. Any deviation exceeding ±3 seconds from Foundation Standard Time requires immediate quarantine and temporal displacement screening.

**Description:** SCPG-008 is a complex thaumaturgic phenomenon orchestrated by a distributed cult network known as the "Thirteenth Hour Confluence" or simply "The Confluence." The cult's ultimate goal is the summoning of an extradimensional entity they refer to as "The Sleeper Beneath the Angles," believed to be a cosmic entity of immense destructive potential existing in a pocket dimension accessible only during specific temporal-spatial convergences.

The Confluence operates through a cell-based structure spanning multiple continents, with individual cells (designated SCPG-008-Alpha) performing synchronized ritualistic activities designed to weaken the barriers between dimensions. These rituals, collectively termed "Hour-Workings," must be performed at precisely calculated moments when local spacetime exhibits specific mathematical properties.

Each SCPG-008-Alpha cell consists of exactly thirteen members, with one designated as the "Chronarch" responsible for temporal calculations and ritual coordination. The Confluence has developed a sophisticated understanding of dimensional mathematics, utilizing principles that appear to predate known human mathematical development by several millennia.

**Addendum 008-1: Initial Discovery**
SCPG-008 first came to Foundation attention on ██/██/20██ following a series of coordinated incidents across seven time zones. Astronomical observatories reported simultaneous "temporal echoes" - electromagnetic signatures appearing to originate from the same stellar coordinates but at different points in time.

The pattern was traced to thirteen ritual sites across North America, each positioned at locations corresponding to vertices of a hyperdimensional geometric construct. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits") discovered the remains of 169 individuals (13 cells × 13 members each) who had undergone ritualistic self-termination at precisely 11:47 PM local time across all sites.

At the center of each ritual circle, investigators found crystalline formations exhibiting non-Euclidean geometry and emitting low-level temporal radiation. Analysis revealed these formations contained compressed spacetime, effectively creating "puncture wounds" in local reality.

**Addendum 008-2: The Voynich Calculations**
Encrypted documentation recovered from Confluence sites included mathematical formulae written in a cipher based on the Voynich Manuscript. Foundation cryptanalysts, working with embedded assets in academic institutions, eventually decoded what the cult refers to as "The Thirteenth Hour Equation" - a complex formula describing the optimal conditions for dimensional breach.

According to these calculations, SCPG-008-Omega (the successful summoning of The Sleeper Beneath the Angles) requires 1,001 synchronized ritual sites operating simultaneously during a specific astronomical configuration that occurs approximately every 2,147 years. Historical analysis suggests previous attempts may have occurred in 127 BCE and 1874 CE, corresponding to unexplained mass disappearances recorded in historical documents.

**Addendum 008-3: Interview with Recovered Cultist**
The following interview was conducted with Subject SCPG-008-1 (formerly Miranda Chen, recovered from a failed ritual site in Oregon) after successful deprogramming using Class-D amnestics and counter-memetic therapy:

**Dr. Harrison:** Can you describe your involvement with the Confluence?

**SCPG-008-1:** We weren't evil. You have to understand that. We were... gardeners. Reality is sick, Doctor. Broken. The angles don't line up anymore. Time moves in stutters and loops. The Sleeper isn't a destroyer—it's a surgeon.

**Dr. Harrison:** What did you believe would happen when this "Sleeper" awakened?

**SCPG-008-1:** The Great Correction. Every timeline that branched wrong would be pruned back. Every paradox resolved. The universe would finally make sense again. We calculated it, Dr. Harrison. Reality has been accumulating errors for millennia. Without intervention, existence itself will collapse into recursive impossibility.

**Dr. Harrison:** How many cells are currently active?

**SCPG-008-1:** [Subject begins crying] You can't stop it. Even if you found us all, the mathematics are already in motion. The Thirteenth Hour doesn't need us anymore—we just helped it remember how to count.

**Addendum 008-4: The Jakarta Manifestation**
On ██/██/20██, SCPG-008 achieved its first successful partial manifestation during a coordinated ritual involving 47 cells across Southeast Asia. The event, designated Incident 008-Tau, resulted in a 2.3-square-kilometer area of Jakarta experiencing what can only be described as "selective temporal displacement."

Within the affected zone, time moved at a rate of 13:1 relative to baseline reality. Inhabitants aged 13 days for every day that passed outside the zone, while experiencing fragmented memories of events that had not yet occurred. Foundation containment teams reported encountering versions of themselves from alternate timelines, all attempting to contain the same incident with varying degrees of success.

The manifestation was terminated after 47 minutes (approximately 10 days subjective time within the zone) when MTF Psi-13 deployed experimental reality anchors. However, the affected area continues to exhibit minor temporal anomalies, with clocks running 0.3 seconds fast and residents occasionally reporting déjà vu experiences with uncanny accuracy.

Post-incident analysis revealed that the Jakarta Manifestation was merely a "test pulse" - the Confluence had successfully demonstrated their ability to breach dimensional barriers on a localized scale.

**Addendum 008-5: Project CHRONOS LOCK**
In response to escalating SCPG-008 activity, the O5 Council authorized Project CHRONOS LOCK, a classified initiative involving the construction of seventeen temporal stabilization facilities at mathematically significant locations worldwide. These facilities, disguised as radio telescopes and seismic monitoring stations, generate standing waves in spacetime designed to interfere with Confluence calculations.

However, Dr. Elena Vasquez (Project CHRONOS LOCK chief researcher) has noted concerning developments:

"The Confluence is adapting to our countermeasures faster than anticipated. They're not just using mathematics—they're using mathematics that learns. Each time we deploy a new interference pattern, they incorporate it into their calculations within weeks. We're not fighting a cult; we're fighting an equation that has achieved consciousness."

**Addendum 008-6: The Sleeper's Shadow**
During a routine surveillance operation, MTF Psi-13 intercepted communications between Confluence cells describing "shadow manifestations" of The Sleeper Beneath the Angles. These brief glimpses of the entity, lasting microseconds during failed summoning attempts, have been documented across multiple sites.

Witness accounts consistently describe The Sleeper as "an absence with weight"—a void in space that nonetheless casts shadows in impossible directions. Dr. Chen's theoretical analysis suggests the entity exists in eleven dimensions simultaneously, making complete manifestation in three-dimensional space geometrically impossible without significant reality restructuring.

This may explain the Confluence's ultimate strategy: rather than bringing The Sleeper into our reality, they intend to transform our reality into something capable of housing it.

**Addendum 008-7: The Final Calculation**
Intercepted Confluence communications indicate they have identified the optimal temporal window for SCPG-008-Omega: ██/██/2027, during a rare planetary alignment that will not reoccur for another 2,147 years. Intelligence suggests 987 of the required 1,001 ritual sites have been prepared, with the remaining 14 cells working to establish final positions.

Most concerning is the discovery that several Foundation sites may be positioned at locations matching Confluence geometric requirements. Site-19, Site-42, and Site-77 all exhibit the specific gravitational and electromagnetic properties necessary for Hour-Working rituals. This suggests either unprecedented infiltration of Foundation operations or that our site selection criteria have been subtly influenced by Confluence agents over decades.

**Current Threat Assessment:**
SCPG-008 represents a potential ZK-Class Reality Failure scenario. The Confluence's understanding of dimensional mathematics exceeds current Foundation capabilities, and their distributed cell structure makes complete elimination impossible within the remaining timeframe.

Dr. Vasquez's final report states: "We are not facing a traditional anomaly that can be contained or neutralized. SCPG-008 is mathematics weaponized against the fundamental structure of reality. The Confluence may be correct in their assessment that reality requires 'correction'—but their cure may be worse than the disease they claim to treat."

The O5 Council has authorized Procedure LAST THEOREM as a final contingency: the deployment of [REDACTED] at all seventeen CHRONOS LOCK facilities, effectively "freezing" local spacetime in a stable configuration. This action would prevent SCPG-008-Omega but would also render affected areas permanently uninhabitable and create paradoxes throughout the global timeline.

**Final Note:**
As of this writing, MTF Psi-13 continues to monitor for SCPG-008-Alpha activity while Foundation researchers work desperately to decode the full implications of the Thirteenth Hour Equation. The clock counts down not in seconds or minutes, but in mathematical possibilities—and the Sleeper Beneath the Angles stirs with each calculation completed.

The Confluence may have made one critical error in their planning: they assume The Sleeper will distinguish between summoner and bystander when it finally awakens. Historical precedent suggests cosmic entities of such magnitude recognize no such distinction.
