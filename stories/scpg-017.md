# SCPG-017: The Reflective Judge

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-017 is to be stored in a dedicated containment cell at Site-22. The cell must be constructed with non-reflective interior surfaces. Illumination within the cell is to be kept below 10 lux, and any direct observation of SCPG-017 must be conducted via remote monochrome cameras equipped with cognitohazard filters. The cell is to be soundproofed to prevent auditory contamination from SCPG-017's secondary effects.

No personnel are to enter SCPG-017's containment cell without Level 4/017 clearance. Personnel assigned to SCPG-017 must undergo psychological screening every 48 hours. Any personnel exhibiting unusual guilt, paranoia, or self-deprecating behavior after potential exposure must be immediately removed from duty, administered Class-C amnestics, and placed under observation for a minimum of 7 days.

Under no circumstances should any individual with a history of severe psychological trauma, unresolved guilt, or a pending disciplinary review be allowed within a 50-meter radius of SCPG-017.

**Description:** SCPG-017 is an ornate, full-length antique mirror, approximately 2 meters tall and 0.8 meters wide. Its frame is constructed from heavily tarnished silver, intricately carved with unknown symbols that bear a superficial resemblance to various historical judicial and religious iconography. The reflective surface itself is flawless and appears to be made of an unknown material that is highly resistant to damage.

SCPG-017's primary anomalous property manifests when a sentient being capable of self-reflection observes their image within it. Instead of a normal reflection, the observer sees a version of themselves (designated SCPG-017-1) that embodies their deepest personal failings, regrets, and perceived wrongdoings. SCPG-017-1 will verbally berate the observer, detailing specific past actions and perceived moral failures with unnerving accuracy, often revealing information not consciously remembered by the observer or known to any other individual.

The vocalizations from SCPG-017-1 are audible not only to the observer but also to anyone within approximately 5 meters of SCPG-017, though only the direct observer will see the altered reflection. The accusations made by SCPG-017-1 are highly personalized and psychologically damaging, often leading to acute distress, severe guilt complexes, and, in prolonged exposures (over 5 minutes), suicidal ideation or psychotic breaks.

Secondary effects include the manifestation of auditory hallucinations in individuals who have previously viewed SCPG-017, where they continue to hear the voice of SCPG-017-1 for periods ranging from several hours to, in rare cases, weeks. These hallucinations typically echo the accusations made during the initial exposure.

SCPG-017 does not appear to be sentient itself but acts as a conduit or amplifier for an unknown force or mechanism that accesses and projects an individual's psychological vulnerabilities. The criteria by which it "judges" actions are inconsistent and do not align with any known ethical or moral framework, sometimes condemning trivial actions with the same severity as major transgressions.

**Addendum 017-1: Discovery**
SCPG-017 was recovered from the estate of the late Lord Ashworth in [REDACTED], England, following reports of his sudden and violent suicide. Local authorities investigating the scene noted several household staff members in states of extreme psychological distress, muttering about "the mirror that speaks truth." Foundation agents embedded in the local constabulary secured the object. Lord Ashworth's journal contained entries describing the mirror as a "confessor and accuser," which he had acquired from an antique dealer specializing in "items of unique provenance." The dealer has not been located.

**Addendum 017-2: Test Log Excerpt - D-9812**
**Subject:** D-9812 (Convicted of multiple counts of fraud)
**Procedure:** Subject instructed to stand before SCPG-017 and report observations.
**[00:00:30]** D-9812: "It's... me. But I look older. Tired."
**[00:01:15]** SCPG-017-1 (Voice of D-9812, distorted): "Remember Mrs. Henderson, Daniel? Her pension? You told her it was a 'guaranteed investment.' You watched her sign it away, knowing."
**[00:01:45]** D-9812: (Visibly distressed) "How... how does it know that? I never told anyone."
**[00:02:30]** SCPG-017-1: "And the charity drive for the children's hospital? How much of that went into your 'operating expenses,' Daniel? Little Timmy never got his new wing, did he?"
**[00:03:10]** D-9812: (Collapses, sobbing) "Stop! Please, stop! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"
**[00:03:45]** Test terminated. D-9812 removed from cell, exhibiting acute emotional breakdown. Subject later attempted self-harm and was placed under medical supervision.

**Addendum 017-3: Researcher Note - Dr. Evelyn Hayes**
"The memetic component of SCPG-017 is particularly insidious. It doesn't just show you what you've done; it frames it in the most psychologically damaging way possible, leveraging your own internal moral compass against you. The accuracy of its 'knowledge' is deeply unsettling. It's not just accessing surface memories; it seems to tap into a deeper, perhaps collective, understanding of an individual's actions and their consequences. We must be extremely cautious with exposure, as the psychological wounds it inflicts are profound and difficult to treat. The question remains: what is the source of its 'judgment,' and what is its ultimate purpose?"

**Addendum 017-4: Incident 017-Delta**
On ██/██/20██, during a routine systems check, a containment breach in an adjacent cell caused a power surge affecting SCPG-017's chamber. For approximately 90 seconds, the cell's primary lights activated to full intensity. Remote cameras showed SCPG-017's surface briefly reflecting not the empty cell, but a swirling, chaotic vista of what appeared to be myriad distorted faces and scenes of intense emotional suffering before returning to its normal reflective state. Simultaneously, all personnel within a 100-meter radius reported a wave of intense, unspecific guilt and sorrow lasting several minutes. Investigation into the nature of this "true reflection" is ongoing, though further attempts to replicate the conditions have been unsuccessful and are deemed too high-risk.
