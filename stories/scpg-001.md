# SCPG-001: The Prototype

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-001 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. The cell is to be monitored at all times via closed-circuit camera. No personnel below Level 4 clearance are permitted direct interaction with SCPG-001.

**Description:** SCPG-001 appears to be a middle-aged human male of average build. The subject demonstrates the ability to alter local reality through spoken commands, though these alterations appear to be limited to a 10-meter radius around the subject.

SCPG-001 claims to be "the first one" and insists that all other SCPG objects are "copies" of its abilities. Investigation into these claims is ongoing.

**Addendum 001-A:** During initial containment, SCPG-001 stated, "You think you understand what you're dealing with, but I am the template from which all others were made."
