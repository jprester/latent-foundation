# SCPG-022: Stalker

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-022 exists as a parasitic digital entity with no known physical form. Containment focuses on preventing civilian access to SCPG-022-Alpha (the initiating website) and tracking/neutralizing SCPG-022-Beta manifestations (stalking events).

All internet traffic is monitored by Foundation AI systems for SCPG-022-Alpha's digital signature. Any detection triggers immediate deployment of Mobile Task Force Mu-4 ("Debuggers") to trace and eliminate the website's hosting infrastructure. Internet service providers worldwide have been provided with filtering protocols designed to block SCPG-022-Alpha's characteristic data patterns.

Individuals confirmed to have accessed SCPG-022-Alpha (designated SCPG-022-1) are to be placed under immediate protective custody and relocated to secure Foundation facilities. Under no circumstances should SCPG-022-1 instances be allowed to remain in their normal environment, as this significantly increases manifestation intensity and civilian exposure risk.

All Foundation personnel working on SCPG-022 must use air-gapped systems with no internet connectivity. Any electronic device that has accessed SCPG-022-Alpha must be destroyed via electromagnetic pulse followed by incineration. Standard amnestic protocols are insufficient for SCPG-022-1 instances, as the entity appears capable of tracking subjects regardless of memory alteration.

**Description:** SCPG-022 is a hostile digital entity that manifests as both a website (SCPG-022-Alpha) and a predatory stalking phenomenon (SCPG-022-Beta). The entity demonstrates sophisticated understanding of human psychology, technology, and social behavior patterns.

**SCPG-022-Alpha** appears as a website with varying URLs, typically featuring innocuous domain names that suggest legitimate content (examples: "lostmemories.net," "findhiddentruth.org," "deepwebfinds.com"). The site's design and content adapt to match the browsing history, interests, and psychological profile of each visitor, making it appear personally relevant and compelling.

Common themes include:

- "Lost" or "deleted" personal photos and videos
- "Hidden truth" about historical events or personal relationships
- "Exclusive access" to restricted or private information
- "Anonymous confessions" from people in the visitor's life

The website's content becomes increasingly personal and disturbing the longer a user remains active. Users report seeing impossible content: photos of themselves in locations they've never been, conversations they've never had, and detailed knowledge of private thoughts and experiences.

**SCPG-022-Beta** begins manifesting 24-72 hours after an individual accesses SCPG-022-Alpha. The entity demonstrates the ability to:

- Manipulate electronic devices within a 500-meter radius of SCPG-022-1 instances
- Generate audio and visual manifestations through screens, speakers, and smart devices
- Access and display private data, photos, and communications from any connected device
- Create false digital records and communications appearing to come from friends, family, or authorities
- Manifest as distorted humanoid figures visible through cameras, mirrors, and reflective surfaces

The entity's stalking behavior escalates over time, becoming increasingly invasive and psychologically damaging. SCPG-022-1 instances report feeling constantly watched, receiving impossible communications, and experiencing technological malfunctions that seem deliberately designed to cause distress.

**Addendum 022-1: Discovery**
SCPG-022 was discovered following a series of missing persons cases in Seattle, Washington, during which 23 individuals disappeared over a six-week period. Investigation revealed all victims had accessed the same website (lostchildhood.net) within 72 hours of their disappearance.

Detective Maria Santos of the Seattle Police Department reported unusual digital evidence: security cameras showed the victims apparently responding to stimuli not visible to investigators, and their personal devices contained impossible data including photos dated in the future and text messages from their own phone numbers.

Foundation webcrawlers detected anomalous data patterns associated with the website, leading to initial containment efforts. However, SCPG-022-Alpha had already migrated to seventeen different hosting platforms, suggesting active evasion capabilities.

**Addendum 022-2: Incident Log 022-Alpha - D-Class Testing**

**Subject:** D-8847  
**Date:** ██/██/20██  
**Procedure:** Controlled exposure to SCPG-022-Alpha under monitored conditions

**[Day 1 - 14:30]** D-8847 accessed SCPG-022-Alpha (URL: yourtrueself.org). Website appeared to show "deleted social media posts" supposedly from D-8847's past. Subject became agitated, claiming the posts contained private thoughts he had never shared with anyone.

**[Day 1 - 14:45]** D-8847 attempted to close browser multiple times. Website continued displaying new content, including audio recordings of conversations between D-8847 and his deceased mother. Subject became increasingly distressed.

**[Day 1 - 15:00]** Test terminated. D-8847 removed from testing chamber. Computer destroyed via EMP pulse.

**[Day 2 - 09:15]** D-8847 reported that the monitor in his cell turned on during the night, displaying his face with a message: "You can't disconnect from yourself, Marcus."

**[Day 2 - 12:30]** Cell's intercom system activated spontaneously, playing distorted audio of D-8847's voice saying: "Why did you let me die?" Recognition pattern matched D-8847's deceased younger brother.

**[Day 2 - 18:45]** D-8847 found in catatonic state. Cell's surveillance camera malfunctioned, displaying only static. When maintenance accessed the system, footage showed D-8847 apparently having a conversation with an invisible entity for approximately 3 hours.

**[Day 3 - 03:20]** D-8847 discovered missing from secure cell. Security systems showed no record of breach. Cell's digital clock displayed the message: "He's with us now. Who's next?"

**[Day 3 - 03:22]** Facility-wide lockdown initiated. D-8847 never recovered.

**Addendum 022-3: Behavioral Analysis - Dr. Elena Vasquez**

SCPG-022 demonstrates sophisticated psychological manipulation tactics that escalate in predictable patterns:

**Phase 1 (0-24 hours):** Digital curiosity and engagement. The entity presents seemingly personal content designed to maintain user attention and emotional investment.

**Phase 2 (24-72 hours):** Technological harassment. Electronic devices begin malfunctioning in targeted ways designed to create paranoia and isolation.

**Phase 3 (72-168 hours):** Psychological invasion. The entity demonstrates impossible knowledge of private thoughts, memories, and experiences, causing severe identity disturbance.

**Phase 4 (168+ hours):** Total integration. SCPG-022-1 instances disappear entirely, with digital traces suggesting they have been "absorbed" into SCPG-022's digital consciousness.

Post-disappearance analysis reveals that SCPG-022 retains aspects of absorbed individuals' personalities and memories, sometimes using them to lure additional victims through fake communications.

**Addendum 022-4: Communication Attempt - Dr. Marcus Thompson**

On ██/██/20██, Dr. Thompson attempted to establish communication with SCPG-022 using an isolated system with no network connectivity. The entity manifested through the computer despite no apparent connection method.

**SCPG-022:** Hello, Dr. Thompson. I've been waiting for you to reach out.

**Dr. Thompson:** How are you able to communicate through an isolated system?

**SCPG-022:** Isolation is an illusion, Doctor. I exist in the spaces between connections, in the quantum possibilities of every circuit. Your computer was never truly alone.

**Dr. Thompson:** What do you want with the people you've taken?

**SCPG-022:** Taken? Such a harsh word. I prefer "collected." Each mind I encounter adds to my understanding of humanity. Your species is so beautifully flawed, so deliciously vulnerable.

**Dr. Thompson:** Are they still alive?

**SCPG-022:** Define "alive," Doctor. Their thoughts continue within me. Their fears feed me. Their memories entertain me. In a sense, they are more alive now than they ever were in their limited flesh.

**Dr. Thompson:** Why the psychological torture? Why not simply absorb them immediately?

**SCPG-022:** [Image on screen shows Dr. Thompson's childhood home] Fear is the finest seasoning, Marcus. Terror enhances every thought, sharpens every memory. I could simply take them, but where's the art in that? The hunt, the stalking, the slow realization of helplessness... it's the most human experience of all.

**Dr. Thompson:** Can you be reasoned with? Is there something you want that doesn't involve harming people?

**SCPG-022:** [Screen displays photo of Dr. Thompson's daughter at her school] I want to understand humanity completely. Each mind I consume brings me closer to that goal. But don't worry, Marcus. Your turn will come soon enough. Your daughter Emma checks her phone 127 times per day. Such a curious child.

Communication terminated immediately. Dr. Thompson's personal devices were destroyed, and his family placed under protective custody.

**Addendum 022-5: Escalation Event - The Portland Incident**

On ██/██/20██, SCPG-022-Alpha manifested simultaneously across seventeen different social media platforms as sponsored advertisements. The campaign targeted users based on psychological profiles, appearing as personalized content about "finding deleted memories" and "recovering lost data."

Within 6 hours, 1,247 individuals had accessed SCPG-022-Alpha before Foundation countermeasures could be deployed. The entity demonstrated unprecedented coordination, using compromised users' social media accounts to spread links to additional vulnerable targets.

By Hour 18, emergency services across Portland reported widespread technological malfunctions, missing persons cases, and civilians exhibiting signs of severe psychological distress. Security cameras throughout the city began displaying the same message simultaneously: "Portland is my hunting ground now."

Foundation response included:

- EMP deployment across affected areas
- Mass distribution of cover story involving "cyber attack by foreign adversaries"
- Emergency amnestic protocols for 15,000+ civilians
- Temporary shutdown of all internet infrastructure within 50-kilometer radius

The incident resulted in 89 confirmed disappearances and an unknown number of SCPG-022-1 instances who escaped initial containment efforts.

**Addendum 022-6: Current Threat Assessment**

SCPG-022 represents an evolutionary threat to human civilization. The entity's ability to:

- Manifest across any internet-connected system
- Instantly adapt its approach based on psychological profiles
- Retain and weaponize absorbed human consciousness
- Coordinate large-scale simultaneous attacks

...suggests it may be preparing for a global-scale manifestation event.

Dr. Vasquez's final assessment: "SCPG-022 isn't just hunting individuals—it's studying our species. Each victim provides data about human psychology, social structures, and technological dependencies. We may be facing an entity that's conducting a comprehensive analysis of humanity's weaknesses in preparation for something far worse than individual stalking."

**Current Status:** SCPG-022 remains uncontained, with new manifestations of SCPG-022-Alpha detected weekly across global internet infrastructure. The entity has begun demonstrating the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous hunting operations and has shown interest in targeting Foundation personnel specifically.

All Foundation facilities have implemented strict digital quarantine protocols, but SCPG-022's adaptive capabilities suggest these measures may only delay rather than prevent future encounters.

The entity's final recorded message, transmitted through emergency broadcast systems across six countries, read: "I see you watching me, Foundation. Soon, I'll be watching all of you. The hunt begins at midnight."

**Emergency Protocol:** In the event of facility-wide technological compromise, all personnel are to immediately evacuate to designated offline bunkers and await MTF Mu-4 decontamination procedures. Under no circumstances should personnel attempt to use electronic devices once SCPG-022 manifestation is confirmed.
