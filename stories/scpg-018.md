# SCPG-018: The Lexicon of Unspoken Truths

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-018 is to be stored in a hermetically sealed, lead-lined container within a dedicated Secure Document Vault at Site-62. Access to SCPG-018 requires Level 4/018 clearance and must be approved by at least two (2) O5 Council members.

Personnel interacting with SCPG-018 must wear full-body hazardous materials suits with independent oxygen supplies and opaque visors. Direct visual or tactile contact with SCPG-018 is strictly prohibited. All handling must be performed via robotic manipulators from an isolated control room.

Any individual exposed to SCPG-018's textual content, even indirectly (e.g., through transcripts or second-hand accounts), must be quarantined immediately, undergo Class-A amnestic treatment, and be monitored for a minimum of 30 days for signs of memetic contamination or cognitive restructuring. Any research involving SCPG-018's content must be conducted using isolated, air-gapped systems, and all generated data must be classified as Level 5 Cognitohazardous Material.

**Description:** SCPG-018 is a leather-bound tome of indeterminate age and origin. The book measures approximately 30cm x 20cm x 10cm. Its cover is made of a dark, leathery material, later identified as tanned human skin, and bears no title or markings. The pages are composed of a vellum-like substance that has resisted all attempts at material analysis and dating. The script within SCPG-018 is an unknown language that shifts and rearranges itself when not under direct observation. No consistent translation has been achieved, as the symbols themselves appear to alter their meaning based on the reader or the context of their observation.

SCPG-018's primary anomalous property manifests when its textual content is perceived by a human subject. Upon reading even a small portion of the text, subjects report gaining sudden, intrusive, and overwhelmingly comprehensive knowledge of unspoken truths, hidden motives, and suppressed thoughts of all individuals within their perceptual range (approximately 20 meters, though this can vary).

This acquired knowledge is not limited to conscious thoughts but extends to subconscious desires, deeply buried secrets, and minute, often unflattering, internal monologues. Subjects exposed to SCPG-018 (designated SCPG-018-1) become acutely aware of the unfiltered internal realities of those around them. This invariably leads to:

- **Acute Social Disintegration:** SCPG-018-1 instances find normal social interaction impossible, as they are bombarded by the raw, often contradictory and negative, inner thoughts of others.
- **Severe Psychological Distress:** The constant influx of unfiltered truths causes extreme paranoia, anxiety, misanthropy, and often leads to violent outbursts or catatonia.
- **Cognitive Dissonance:** Subjects struggle to reconcile the perceived external behavior of individuals with their now-exposed internal thoughts, leading to a breakdown of trust and an inability to form coherent social models.

There is no known way to "unlearn" the knowledge gained from SCPG-018, short of amnestic treatment, which carries its own risks of personality alteration. The book itself appears to be a passive vector for this infohazard; it does not demonstrate sentience but acts as a repository or conduit for this anomalous form of perception.

**Addendum 018-1: Discovery**
SCPG-018 was discovered in the possession of a reclusive linguist, Professor Alistair Finch, after he was found deceased in his study in [REDACTED], Oxford, UK. The cause of death was self-inflicted. His study was filled with frantic, paranoid writings detailing his experiences after acquiring the book from an anonymous source. He described the book as "a cursed key to every soul's darkest cellar." Foundation agents, alerted by anomalous linguistic patterns in his notes, secured SCPG-018. Several first-responding local law enforcement officers were exposed and required amnestic treatment.

**Addendum 018-2: Test Log Excerpt - Agent Davies (Controlled Exposure)**
**Subject:** Agent Davies (Selected for high psychological resilience, volunteer)
**Procedure:** Subject equipped with remote monitoring, instructed to open SCPG-018 to a random page and read one sentence, then immediately close it.
**[00:00:05]** Agent Davies opens SCPG-018. Reads.
**[00:00:08]** Agent Davies: (Eyes widen) "Oh. Oh, God."
**[00:00:15]** Agent Davies: (Looking at Dr. Thorne in the observation room via one-way mirror) "Doctor, you're thinking about how my tie is crooked and how you resent having to oversee this 'D-Class-level errand.' And you, Agent Myers (looking at another observer), you're wondering if I'll break... and you're slightly hoping I do, for the data."
**[00:00:30]** Dr. Thorne: (Via intercom) "Agent Davies, please describe your current sensory input."
**[00:00:45]** Agent Davies: (Voice strained) "It's... everything. Everyone. The technician in the hall is worried about his mortgage. The security guard outside is replaying an argument with his wife. It's too much. Their... their _real_ thoughts are so loud. So petty. So... naked."
**[00:01:10]** Agent Davies begins to hyperventilate. "I can't... I can hear what you're _all_ thinking about me right now. About each other. It's... disgusting. It's all lies on the surface!"
**[00:01:30]** Test terminated. Agent Davies extracted. Subject became violent during extraction, screaming about the "cacophony of deceit." Subject was sedated and administered Class-A amnestics. Full psychological recovery took 6 weeks, with lingering mild paranoia.

**Addendum 018-3: Theoretical Implications - Dr. Anya Sharma**
"SCPG-018 doesn't seem to create thoughts, but rather removes a fundamental cognitive filter that allows for social cohesion. Humans rely on a degree of unspoken understanding, polite fictions, and the privacy of their own minds to function as a society. SCPG-018 strips that away, exposing the raw, uncurated psyche. The language of the book itself might be less important than its function as an anomalous 'key' to this unfiltered perception. The shifting nature of the text could be a reflection of the chaotic, ever-changing nature of the collective subconscious it allows one to tap into. The danger here isn't just to the individual reader, but potentially to societal structures if its effects were widespread. Imagine a world with no white lies, no private thoughts – only brutal, unfiltered honesty. It would be ungovernable."

**Addendum 018-4: Cross-SCP Anomaly Interaction Attempt (Denied)**
Request to expose SCP-████ (a non-sentient, info-based anomaly) to SCPG-018 to determine if the book's effects are limited to biological consciousness was denied by O5-█, citing unacceptable risk of creating a cascading infohazardous event or unpredictably empowering SCP-████. The nature of what SCPG-018 reveals is already too volatile to risk amplifying or transferring its properties.
