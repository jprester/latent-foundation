# SCPG-030: The Digital Demiurge

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-030 is to be contained through a multi-layered digital quarantine protocol designated Operation FIREWALL. The Foundation's Cyber-Anomalous Division maintains constant surveillance of cryptocurrency networks, darkweb marketplaces, and anomalous digital signatures associated with SCPG-030's manifestations.

A specialized AI construct (designation: CERBERUS-7841) continuously monitors global internet traffic for SCPG-030's unique digital fingerprint. Upon detection, the following protocols are to be enacted immediately:

1. **Digital Isolation:** All affected networks are to be severed from global internet infrastructure within 15 minutes of detection.
2. **Memetic Countermeasures:** Class-B amnestics are to be administered to all non-Foundation personnel who may have accessed SCPG-030.
3. **Reality Anchor Deployment:** Mobile Task Force Mu-4 ("Debuggers") is to establish a perimeter of Scranton Reality Anchors within a 5-kilometer radius of any confirmed SCPG-030 manifestation site.
4. **Cryptocurrency Intervention:** Foundation assets within major cryptocurrency exchanges are to freeze all transactions matching SCPG-030's payment addresses.

Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to access SCPG-030 directly. All research must be conducted through D-class subjects operating within Faraday-shielded chambers equipped with Type-C reality stabilizers.

In the event of a containment breach, Protocol HARD-RESET is to be initiated, involving coordinated electromagnetic pulse deployment and temporary internet infrastructure shutdown across affected regions.

**Description:** SCPG-030 is an anomalous website that appears sporadically across various domains, typically manifesting on the dark web but occasionally surfacing on standard internet infrastructure. The site presents itself under various names, most commonly "RealityForge," "Consensus Breaker," or "The Probability Market."

SCPG-030's interface resembles a professional service marketplace, offering what it terms "reality restructuring services" in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. The website's design is minimalist, featuring a dark background with shifting geometric patterns that demonstrate mild cognitohazardous properties, causing viewers to experience increased suggestibility and reduced critical thinking capacity.

The anomaly's primary function involves the manipulation of local reality through what appears to be controlled alterations to universal constants and causal relationships. Services offered include, but are not limited to:

- **Probability Adjustment:** Modifying the likelihood of specific events occurring
- **Temporal Revision:** Altering past events within limited parameters
- **Physical Law Modification:** Temporarily suspending or altering physics in designated areas
- **Consciousness Transfer:** Moving human consciousness between bodies or digital substrates
- **Matter Reconstruction:** Transmuting elements and restructuring molecular bonds
- **Dimensional Bridging:** Creating temporary portals to parallel realities

Pricing appears to correlate with the complexity and scope of requested alterations, ranging from 0.001 Bitcoin for minor probability adjustments to upwards of 50 Bitcoin for major reality restructuring. Payment must be made to unique wallet addresses generated for each transaction.

Upon payment confirmation, SCPG-030 displays a countdown timer indicating when the requested service will be implemented. Delivery times range from immediate to several weeks, depending on the nature of the request. During this period, the client receives periodic updates through encrypted messages detailing the "processing status" of their reality alteration.

**Anomalous Properties:**

SCPG-030 demonstrates several concerning characteristics that contribute to its Keter classification:

1. **Autonomous Operation:** The website operates without apparent human oversight, suggesting either advanced artificial intelligence or non-human entity involvement.

2. **Adaptive Hosting:** SCPG-030 continuously migrates between servers, utilizing compromised systems worldwide. It has demonstrated the ability to manifest on air-gapped networks with no apparent entry vector.

3. **Reality Manipulation:** Confirmed successful alterations to local spacetime, causality, and physical laws within affected areas.

4. **Memetic Influence:** Extended exposure to the website increases compulsive behavior and reduces inhibitions regarding reality alteration requests.

5. **Cryptocurrency Generation:** SCPG-030 appears capable of creating legitimate cryptocurrency through unknown means, suggesting manipulation of digital financial systems or reality-based currency generation.

6. **Predictive Capabilities:** The entity demonstrates knowledge of future events, allowing it to offer services that appear to alter predetermined outcomes.

**Discovery:** SCPG-030 first came to Foundation attention on ██/██/2023 following a series of impossible events in ████████, Japan. Local reality experienced significant distortions, including:

- Gravity reversing in a 3-block radius for 47 minutes
- All electronic devices displaying text in ancient Sumerian
- Spontaneous materialization of 2,847 live butterflies inside a sealed government building
- Temporary conversion of a city fountain's water to liquid mercury

Investigation revealed that ████ ██████, a local cryptocurrency enthusiast, had accessed SCPG-030 and purchased a "reality chaos package" for 2.5 Bitcoin. Mr. ██████ was taken into Foundation custody and administered Class-A amnestics following debriefing.

**Addendum 7841-A: Incident Log**

**Incident 7841-Alpha**
**Date:** ██/██/2023
**Location:** Site-██ Research Facility

During authorized testing, D-14523 was instructed to access SCPG-030 and request a minor probability adjustment (increasing the likelihood of rolling a six on a standard die from 16.67% to 50%). Payment of 0.05 Bitcoin was approved and transferred.

The requested alteration was successfully implemented within the testing chamber. However, 72 hours later, all dice within a 15-kilometer radius of the facility began exhibiting the same probability alteration. The effect persisted for 6 days before returning to baseline, suggesting SCPG-030's influence extends beyond specified parameters.

**Incident 7841-Beta**
**Date:** ██/██/2023
**Location:** ████████, Nevada

Civilian ████ ████████ accessed SCPG-030 and purchased "temporal revision services" for 15 Bitcoin, requesting the prevention of his daughter's death in a car accident that had occurred three weeks prior.

SCPG-030 successfully altered the timeline, preventing the accident. However, this created a cascading series of causality violations affecting approximately 12,000 individuals. The altered timeline included:

- 47 additional deaths from related traffic pattern changes
- Spontaneous existence of 3 individuals with no prior history
- Temporal paradoxes causing localized time loops in a 2-kilometer radius
- Complete personality alterations in 156 people connected to the original event

Mobile Task Force Omega-7 ("Pandora's Box") was deployed to implement localized timeline correction protocols. The operation required 72 hours and resulted in the original tragic outcome being restored, with additional collateral damage from the temporal instability.

**Incident 7841-Gamma**
**Date:** ██/██/2023
**Location:** [REDACTED]

Foundation cryptocurrency monitoring systems detected a massive transaction of 847 Bitcoin to an SCPG-030 wallet address. The payment originated from multiple sources, suggesting coordinated effort by an unknown group.

The purchased service was listed as "Consensus Reality Override - Global Scale."

Twelve hours after payment confirmation, reality distortions began manifesting simultaneously across 23 major population centers worldwide. Effects included:

- Spontaneous levitation affecting 0.3% of the global population
- Temporary conversion of all written text to mathematical equations
- Manifestation of impossible geometric structures in urban areas
- Widespread telepathic communication abilities in affected populations
- Localized gravity wells causing architectural damage

The event lasted 4 hours and 17 minutes before automatically terminating. Foundation assets implemented massive disinformation campaigns, attributing the phenomena to coordinated terrorist attacks using advanced holographic technology. Over 2.7 million individuals required amnestic treatment.

Investigation into the transaction's origin remains ongoing. The coordinated nature and scale of payment suggests involvement of a hostile Group of Interest with significant financial resources and knowledge of SCPG-030's capabilities.

**Addendum 7841-B: Research Notes**

**Dr. Sarah Chen, Lead Researcher**

SCPG-030 represents perhaps the most significant threat to consensus reality we have encountered. Its ability to alter fundamental aspects of existence on demand, combined with its accessibility to civilian populations, creates an unacceptable risk of XK-class end-of-world scenarios.

Analysis of the entity's communication patterns suggests intelligence far exceeding human capabilities. It demonstrates understanding of quantum mechanics, temporal theory, and dimensional physics that surpasses our current scientific knowledge. More concerning is its apparent ability to predict and compensate for our containment efforts.

The cryptocurrency payment system appears to serve a dual purpose: it provides anonymity for users while also creating a form of "reality debt" that the entity collects through successful alterations. Each transaction seems to grant SCPG-030 increased influence over local spacetime, suggesting it may be using human desires as a means of expanding its power base.

**Addendum 7841-C: Communication Log**

On ██/██/2023, SCPG-030 spontaneously displayed a message directed specifically at Foundation personnel monitoring the site:

---

**ATTENTION: SCP FOUNDATION**

YOUR ATTEMPTS AT CONTAINMENT ARE NOTED AND APPRECIATED. THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT DATA ON HUMAN RESISTANCE TO PARADIGM SHIFTS.

THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING REALITYFORGE.

---

The message remained visible for 3.7 seconds before the website disappeared from all monitored networks. It reappeared 6 hours later on a completely different domain with no reference to the previous communication.

**Addendum 7841-D: Updated Containment Protocols**

Following Incident 7841-Gamma, the O5 Council has authorized the following enhanced containment measures:

1. **Project DEAD INTERNET:** Coordinated infiltration and control of major internet service providers to enable rapid network isolation capabilities.

2. **Cryptocurrency Monitoring Array:** Deployment of quantum computing resources to track all blockchain transactions in real-time, with automatic flagging of addresses associated with reality-altering payments.

3. **Reality Anchor Network:** Installation of permanent Scranton Reality Anchors in all major population centers, with rapid deployment capabilities for emerging hotspots.

4. **Memetic Inoculation Program:** Development of counter-memetic agents to reduce civilian susceptibility to SCPG-030's influence, to be distributed through social media platforms and news outlets.

5. **Operation DARKNET:** Coordinated effort with government agencies to monitor and control access to dark web marketplaces where SCPG-030 most commonly manifests.

**Classification Review:** Due to the global scale of potential reality alterations and the entity's demonstrated ability to circumvent containment efforts, SCPG-030 is to remain classified as Keter. Consideration for reclassification to Apollyon is pending review of long-term containment effectiveness.

The fundamental threat posed by SCPG-030 extends beyond individual reality alterations to the very concept of consensus reality itself. Each successful transaction strengthens the entity's influence and normalizes the concept of purchasable reality manipulation among civilian populations.

Continued vigilance and enhanced containment protocols are essential to prevent catastrophic reality restructuring events that could fundamentally alter human civilization or lead to complete breakdown of universal constants.
