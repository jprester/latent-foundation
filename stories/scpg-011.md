# SCPG-011: The Bureaucratic Infestation

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The "OmniCorp Tower" (officially designated Provisional Site-112) located at [REDACTED COORDINATES], [CITY, STATE], is under permanent quarantine. A 500-meter exclusion zone, disguised as an ongoing urban redevelopment project, is maintained by embedded Foundation personnel (Task Force Sigma-12 "Urban Planners"). All utilities and network connections to Provisional Site-112 have been physically severed at the municipal level.

Automated sensor arrays (audio, visual, memetic-signature detectors) continuously monitor the interior of Provisional Site-112. Any significant alteration in SCPG-011's internal structure, or any attempt by SCPG-011-influenced phenomena to breach the quarantine perimeter, must be reported to Level 4 Command immediately.

No personnel are to enter Provisional Site-112 without explicit O5 Council authorization. Any authorized exploratory or maintenance missions must be conducted by Mobile Task Force Zeta-29 ("Paper Pushers"), equipped with Class-IV memetic shielding, closed-circuit life support, and reality-stabilizing anchors. All personnel exiting Provisional Site-112 must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine and extensive psychological de-briefing, including memetic counter-agent administration.

**Description:** SCPG-011 is an anomalous phenomenon localized within the OmniCorp Tower. It manifests as a progressive, seemingly intelligent alteration of the building's physical structure, internal systems, and the behavior of any human subjects previously within. The overarching effect is the transformation of the building into an increasingly complex, self-perpetuating, and nonsensical bureaucratic entity.

Initial manifestations of SCPG-011 include:

- Office equipment (computers, printers, intercoms) spontaneously activating to produce or disseminate documents, forms, and directives (designated SCPG-011-A). These materials are characterized by esoteric jargon, contradictory instructions, infinitely recursive procedures, and flowcharts detailing impossible tasks.
- Subtle behavioral changes in individuals within the building, including an obsessive focus on trivial administrative tasks, the development of elaborate but pointless office rituals, and communication increasingly reliant on the jargon found in SCPG-011-A instances.

As SCPG-011's influence progresses:

- The physical layout of the office floors undergoes anomalous restructuring. New departments, wings, and even entire floors with absurd or paradoxical purposes (e.g., "Department of Pre-emptive Retraction," "Office for the Standardization of Ambiguity," "Sub-Committee for Inter-Departmental Inertia") manifest, often overnight. These new areas are fully furnished and integrated into the building's infrastructure.
- Human subjects (designated SCPG-011-B) become fully subsumed by the anomaly. They lose all memory of their previous identities and roles, adopting new titles and responsibilities within SCPG-011's structure (e.g., "Senior Facilitator of Lateral Obfuscation," "Under-Archivist of Redundant Forms"). SCPG-011-B instances engage in perpetual, circular "work," such as generating, filing, cross-referencing, and then shredding SCPG-011-A documents. They exhibit no distress and react with confusion or hostility to any attempts to deviate from their assigned "duties."
- The building's automated systems (HVAC, lighting, security) become integrated into SCPG-011's "operations," often enforcing arbitrary rules derived from SCPG-011-A (e.g., restricting access to certain areas based on the possession of a specific, non-existent form).

The mechanism of SCPG-011's propagation is believed to be primarily memetic, through exposure to SCPG-011-A materials and prolonged presence within the affected environment. There is also evidence of a subtle spatial distortion component that facilitates the physical restructuring of the building.

**Addendum 011-1: Discovery**
SCPG-011 was identified on ██/██/20██, after OmniCorp Tower experienced a sudden communications blackout. Local emergency services responding to welfare checks reported encountering individuals who spoke only in convoluted bureaucratic language and were engaged in bizarre, repetitive office tasks. Foundation assets embedded in municipal services flagged the event, and MTF Zeta-29 was deployed. Initial entry teams confirmed the anomalous nature of the building's interior and the complete assimilation of its approximately 650 occupants. These individuals are now classified as SCPG-011-B and considered irrecoverable.

**Addendum 011-2: Incident Log 011-Gamma**
On ██/██/20██, remote sensors detected the spontaneous manifestation of a "Department of External Compliance and Procedural Integration" on the ground floor of Provisional Site-112. SCPG-011-A materials produced by this "department" included draft "memoranda of understanding" and "inter-agency regulatory frameworks" seemingly designed to interface with external municipal and corporate entities. Simultaneously, anomalous data packets mimicking official city government communications were detected attempting to originate from Provisional Site-112's severed network uplink. Emergency counter-protocols, including localized EMP bursts at network junctions, were initiated, successfully preventing external propagation. This incident highlighted SCPG-011's potential desire or directive to expand its influence.

**Addendum 011-3: Excerpt from Psychological Assessment of MTF Zeta-29 Operative (Post-Exploration Mission 011-04)**
**Dr. Miles Corbin:** "Operative, can you describe the 'meeting' you observed on the 27th floor?"
**Zeta-29-Delta:** "It was... orderly. They were all there, around a large table. Titles like 'Chief Synergist of Circular Reporting' and 'Director of Proactive Stagnation.' They weren't speaking. Just... passing forms. One would sign, pass it on. The next would stamp it, pass it on. It went around the table, then back to the first one, who would place it in a 'Pending Incineration' tray. Then they'd start with a new form. The same form."
**Dr. Corbin:** "Did you feel any compulsion to join them?"
**Zeta-29-Delta:** (Pauses) "There was a certain... logic to it. A clarity. For a moment, the paperwork... it made sense. My memetic dampeners kicked in hard. Felt like an ice pick in the prefrontal cortex. But yeah, for a second... I wanted to pick up a pen."

**Addendum 011-4: O5 Council Directive**
SCPG-011 represents a unique memetic and spatial threat. Its ability to transform mundane environments and human consciousness into a self-sustaining, nonsensical bureaucratic system is deeply concerning. While currently contained, its demonstrated attempts at external propagation necessitate ongoing vigilance. Research into the underlying "logic" of SCPG-011 and potential counter-memetics is authorized but must be conducted with extreme caution. Any further signs of attempted expansion will trigger a review for potential Keter reclassification and more aggressive containment protocols. The [REDACTED] Office Tower is to be considered a permanent loss.
