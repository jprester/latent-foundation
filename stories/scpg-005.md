# SCPG-005: The Somnambulist's Atlas

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-005 is to be stored in a climate-controlled, electromagnetically shielded containment locker at Site-19's High-Value Artifact Wing. Access to SCPG-005 requires Level 3 authorization and must be approved by at least two (2) members of the Site-19 research staff. Under no circumstances are personnel permitted to sleep within a 10-meter radius of SCPG-005 outside of approved testing parameters.

Testing involving SCPG-005 must be conducted in a dedicated, soundproofed chamber equipped with EEG monitoring and emergency medical equipment. D-Class personnel selected for testing must undergo rigorous psychological screening prior to and following exposure. Any personnel exhibiting signs of prolonged dream-state contamination (see Addendum 005-2) are to be quarantined and administered Class-B amnestics.

In the event of unauthorized activation or suspected dream-state contamination outside of testing, Procedure Morpheus-7 is to be enacted: all personnel within a 50-meter radius are to be evacuated, and the affected area is to be flooded with SR-Gas (Somnolence Reducer) until SCPG-005 can be safely retrieved and secured.

**Description:** SCPG-005 is an antique leather-bound atlas, measuring approximately 45cm x 30cm x 5cm. The cover is made of worn, dark brown leather with no discernible title or markings. The paper of the maps within appears to be vellum, and the cartography depicts geographical locations that do not correspond to any known terrestrial or celestial bodies. The ink used for the maps emits a faint, anomalous energy signature, primarily in the theta-wave spectrum.

SCPG-005's primary anomalous property manifests when a sentient being enters REM sleep within an approximate 5-meter radius of the object. Affected individuals (designated SCPG-005-1) will experience highly vivid and unusually coherent dreams. If multiple individuals are within the effective radius, they will experience a shared dreamscape, the content of which appears to be influenced by the collective subconscious of the subjects, often drawing upon latent anxieties, memories, or desires.

These shared dreamscapes (designated SCPG-005-A instances) are not merely passive experiences. Subjects report the ability to interact with the dream environment and each other, often with a heightened sense of realism. However, SCPG-005-A instances frequently feature unsettling or paradoxical elements, and the "narrative" of the dream can shift unpredictably. Prolonged or repeated exposure to SCPG-005-A can lead to dream-reality confusion, residual emotional distress, and, in rare cases, the manifestation of psychosomatic symptoms corresponding to dream events.

The maps within SCPG-005 appear to dynamically alter, with new geographical features or annotations appearing after a shared dream event. These alterations often subtly reflect the experiences or emotional states of the subjects involved in the preceding SCPG-005-A instance. Attempts to decipher the language or symbols used in these annotations are ongoing.

**Addendum 005-1: Discovery**
SCPG-005 was recovered on ██/██/20██ from a small, private library in [REDACTED], Vermont, following reports of a family experiencing identical, recurring nightmares of increasing intensity. The family members described navigating bizarre, shifting landscapes together in their dreams. Foundation agents, investigating under the guise of paranormal researchers, identified SCPG-005 as the source of the phenomenon. The family was administered Class-C amnestics, and a cover story involving localized gas leaks was disseminated.

**Addendum 005-2: Incident Log 005-Alpha**
During initial testing on ██/██/20██, three D-Class personnel (D-4823, D-5011, D-5098) were instructed to sleep in a chamber with SCPG-005. All three subjects reported entering a shared dreamscape depicting a vast, labyrinthine library constructed from obsidian. Within the dream, they encountered entities described as "shadow librarians" who pursued them relentlessly.

Upon waking, D-4823 exhibited severe anxiety and claimed to still hear the "rustling pages" from the dream. D-5011 developed an acute phobia of enclosed spaces. D-5098 became catatonic for 72 hours, muttering phrases in an unknown language that partially matched annotations later found in SCPG-005. All three subjects required Class-B amnestic treatment. Post-incident analysis of SCPG-005 revealed a new section of the atlas depicting a structure resembling the "obsidian library."

**Addendum 005-3: Researcher Note - Dr. Aris Thorne**
The cartographic alterations within SCPG-005 are particularly concerning. It's not just mapping dreams; it seems to be _learning_ from them, or perhaps, _guiding_ them. The correlation between the dream content and the subsequent map changes is too precise to be coincidental. We are observing what appears to be a feedback loop. The question is, what is the ultimate purpose of this "atlas"? Is it merely a recorder, or is it charting a path to somewhere... or something? Further research into the extradimensional properties of the depicted locations is strongly recommended, albeit with extreme caution. The potential for SCPG-005 to act as a gateway, even if only a conceptual one, cannot be dismissed.

**Conclusion**
SCPG-005 represents a unique challenge in understanding the interplay between consciousness, shared experience, and potentially extradimensional spaces. While its immediate physical threat is low, the psychological and memetic implications of its dream-weaving capabilities are significant. The object's ability to seemingly "map" these shared subconscious realms warrants continued, careful investigation. The primary concern remains the long-term psychological stability of individuals exposed to SCPG-005-A instances and the unknown nature of the "locations" it charts.
