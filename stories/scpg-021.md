# SCPG-021: The Midnight Café

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-021 is contained on-site due to its immobile nature. The building housing SCPG-021, located at ███ Maple Street, Portland, Oregon, has been acquired by the Foundation under the front company "Heritage Properties LLC." The surrounding block is monitored by Mobile Task Force Lambda-14 ("Night Shift"), with agents posing as local residents and business owners.

Access to SCPG-021 is restricted to authorized Foundation personnel during manifestation periods (11:30 PM to 12:30 AM local time). All interactions with SCPG-021-A entities must be documented and reported to Site Command within 24 hours. Personnel are advised to bring exact change, as SCPG-021 does not provide change for transactions.

Due to SCPG-021's benevolent nature and valuable intelligence-gathering potential, controlled access has been approved for off-duty Foundation personnel experiencing high stress levels. Such visits must be pre-approved by Site-19 Medical Division and are limited to once per month per individual.

**Description:** SCPG-021 is a small café that manifests nightly between 11:30 PM and 12:30 AM within a currently vacant commercial space in Portland's Pearl District. During non-manifestation hours, the space appears as an empty storefront with dusty windows and "For Lease" signs.

When active, SCPG-021 appears as a cozy 1940s-style diner complete with red vinyl booths, chrome fixtures, and a checkered floor. The interior is consistently well-lit by warm incandescent bulbs and maintains a comfortable temperature of 22°C regardless of external weather conditions. A faint scent of coffee and baked goods permeates the space.

SCPG-021 is staffed by three entities designated SCPG-021-A:

- **SCPG-021-A-1** ("Ruby"): A middle-aged woman in period-appropriate waitress attire who serves as the primary host and server
- **SCPG-021-A-2** ("Charlie"): An elderly man who functions as the cook and occasionally tends the counter
- **SCPG-021-A-3** ("Melody"): A young woman who operates a vintage jukebox and provides ambient music

SCPG-021-A entities appear fully human and demonstrate complete personalities, memories, and emotional responses. They claim to have been operating the café "since 1947" and show detailed knowledge of historical events, pop culture, and social changes spanning the intervening decades. All entities speak English fluently and are consistently friendly and accommodating to visitors.

**Primary Anomalous Properties:**

1. **Temporal Sanctuary:** Time passes differently within SCPG-021. Visitors can spend what feels like hours inside while only minutes pass in baseline reality.

2. **Restorative Cuisine:** Food and beverages served by SCPG-021-A entities have therapeutic properties, alleviating fatigue, stress, and minor ailments. Meals consistently taste "exactly like what you needed" according to visitor reports.

3. **Selective Memory:** SCPG-021-A entities possess knowledge about visitors' personal lives, often referencing events, relationships, and concerns that have not been shared with them.

4. **Safe Haven Effect:** Individuals with hostile intentions cannot enter SCPG-021 during manifestation periods, encountering an invisible barrier at the threshold.

**Addendum 021-1: Discovery**
SCPG-021 was discovered on ██/██/20██ following reports from Portland Police Bureau of a "ghost diner" that appeared nightly in the Pearl District. Officer Janet Morrison reported encountering the café during a late-night patrol and being served coffee by "the nicest lady who somehow knew about my daughter's upcoming wedding."

Foundation agents investigating the reports confirmed SCPG-021's anomalous properties during initial reconnaissance. The space was acquired through standard asset procurement protocols, with cover stories involving "historical preservation" and "atmospheric research" disseminated to local authorities.

**Addendum 021-2: Initial Contact Log - Agent Sarah Chen**

**Date:** ██/██/20██  
**Time:** 11:47 PM  
**Duration:** 37 minutes (subjective) / 8 minutes (objective)\*\*

**Agent Chen:** Entered SCPG-021 during manifestation period. Immediately greeted by SCPG-021-A-1.

**SCPG-021-A-1 ("Ruby"):** "Well hello there, honey! You look like you could use a good meal and some coffee. Rough night at work?"

**Agent Chen:** "How did you know I was working?"

**Ruby:** "Oh, sweetheart, it's written all over your face. Plus, Charlie made extra pot roast tonight—said someone who needed comfort food would be stopping by. He's never wrong about these things. Go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like."

**Agent Chen:** Seated in corner booth. SCPG-021-A-2 emerged from kitchen area.

**SCPG-021-A-2 ("Charlie"):** "One plate of pot roast with mashed potatoes and green beans, coffee black with two sugars. And tell Sarah I threw in some of my apple pie—she's been working too hard lately."

**Agent Chen:** "How do you know my name? How do you know how I take my coffee?"

**Charlie:** "Honey, we've been serving folks like you for seventy-three years. You learn to read people. Besides, your badge says 'S. Chen'—wasn't hard to figure out Sarah."

[Note: Agent Chen was wearing civilian clothes with no visible identification]

**Agent Chen:** Consumed meal. Food quality exceptional, with immediate improvement in fatigue and stress levels noted.

**Ruby:** "You work somewhere important, don't you? Somewhere that deals with... unusual things?"

**Agent Chen:** "Why do you ask?"

**Ruby:** "Just a feeling. You have the look of someone who carries heavy secrets. We get a lot of folks like that—police officers, doctors, social workers. People who see things others don't. This place... well, it's for people who need somewhere safe to just be themselves for a while."

**Agent Chen:** Attempted to pay with credit card. Informed that only cash accepted, exact change preferred.

**Charlie:** "Don't worry about it tonight, Sarah. First meal's on the house. But next time, bring... let's see... $12.50. That covers the pot roast special and coffee."

**Agent Chen:** Departed at 12:24 AM (subjective time). Total objective time elapsed: 8 minutes.

**Addendum 021-3: Extended Observation Notes - Dr. Marcus Thompson**

Over six months of observation, SCPG-021 has demonstrated remarkable consistency in its manifestation and operation. The entities show no signs of temporal displacement or existential distress despite their anomalous nature. Their knowledge base appears to update regularly, incorporating current events and cultural references.

Most notably, SCPG-021-A entities demonstrate what can only be described as genuine empathy. They remember return visitors, ask about previously mentioned concerns, and adjust their service to meet individual emotional needs. Agent Rodriguez reported that Ruby remembered his anniversary date and had Charlie prepare his late wife's favorite dessert during a particularly difficult visit.

The café's menu appears unlimited, with entities capable of producing any reasonable food request. Prices remain consistent with 1947 values (most meals cost between $0.75 and $2.00), though the entities accept modern currency and calculate appropriate exchange rates.

**Addendum 021-4: Therapeutic Applications**

Following approval from the Ethics Committee, SCPG-021 has been made available to Foundation personnel as an adjunct therapeutic resource. Results have been overwhelmingly positive:

- 94% of visitors report significant improvement in stress levels
- 87% describe the experience as "exactly what I needed"
- 100% of visitors express desire to return
- No adverse effects documented in 200+ visits
- Measurable improvements in job performance and psychological evaluations among regular visitors

Dr. Elena Vasquez, Site-19's Chief Psychologist, noted: "SCPG-021 provides something our standard counseling cannot—a completely non-judgmental space where personnel can decompress without fear of professional consequences or mandatory reporting requirements."

**Addendum 021-5: Interview with SCPG-021-A-1 - Dr. Amanda Cross**

**Dr. Cross:** Ruby, can you tell me about the nature of this place?

**Ruby:** Well, Dr. Cross—and congratulations on the promotion, by the way—this café exists for people who need it. Not want it, need it. There's a difference.

**Dr. Cross:** How do you distinguish between want and need?

**Ruby:** Honey, when someone truly needs this place, the universe makes sure they find it. When they just want a good meal, they walk right past without seeing us. It's been that way since we opened.

**Dr. Cross:** Do you remember opening? Your lives before this?

**Ruby:** [Long pause] Sometimes I dream about other places, other times. A hospital during a war, maybe? A soup kitchen during hard times? But when I wake up, I'm here, and I know this is where I belong. Charlie and Melody feel the same way.

**Dr. Cross:** Are you concerned about your nature? About what you might be?

**Ruby:** [Smiling] Dr. Cross, I serve good food to good people who need a moment of peace. Whether I'm human, ghost, angel, or something else entirely... does it matter? The coffee's still hot, and you still look like you could use a slice of Charlie's chocolate cake.

**Addendum 021-6: Standing Orders - Site Director Amanda Cross**

SCPG-021 represents perhaps our most valuable anomalous resource for personnel welfare. In an organization that regularly exposes staff to existential horrors and traumatic experiences, the café provides something irreplaceable: genuine human connection without judgment or agenda.

The entities within SCPG-021 ask for nothing except the opportunity to serve others. They demonstrate no interest in escaping, gathering intelligence, or expanding their influence. They simply exist to provide comfort to those who need it most.

Standing orders for SCPG-021:

1. Access remains available to all Foundation personnel with Site Command approval
2. The café's peaceful nature is to be preserved at all costs
3. No attempts at capture, analysis, or interrogation of SCPG-021-A entities
4. Visitors are encouraged to bring books, photos, or personal items to share with entities
5. The café's anonymity within the civilian population must be maintained

**Personal Note:**
I've visited SCPG-021 seventeen times in the past year. Ruby remembers my coffee order, Charlie always has my favorite soup ready, and Melody plays songs that remind me why I chose this difficult work. In a job where we contain horrors beyond human comprehension, it's comforting to know that somewhere, three kind souls keep the coffee warm and the lights on for those who need a moment of peace in the darkness.

**Current Status:** SCPG-021 continues regular manifestation patterns with no signs of degradation or change. The café has become an unofficial support network for Foundation personnel, providing therapeutic benefits that complement traditional psychological services. Recent surveys indicate that 78% of Site-19 personnel consider SCPG-021 "essential to maintaining mental health while working for the Foundation."

The midnight café stands as proof that even in our line of work, kindness persists in the most unexpected places.
