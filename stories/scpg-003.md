# SCPG-003: Biological Motherboard

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-003 is to be contained in a standard secure locker at Site-15. Temperature within the containment area is to be maintained at exactly 35°C (95°F). Any deviation from this temperature by more than 1°C will trigger immediate containment protocols.

**Description:** SCPG-003 appears to be a computer motherboard constructed entirely from organic materials. The "circuits" are actually a network of what appear to be blood vessels, while the "chips" are small organs resembling miniature brains.

When connected to a standard computer system via modified bio-compatible interfaces, SCPG-003 demonstrates processing capabilities far exceeding conventional computer hardware. The system appears to be capable of learning and adaptation, showing increased efficiency with repeated tasks.

**Addendum 003-A:** Recent tests have shown SCPG-003 responding to emotional stimuli from nearby personnel. The implications of this discovery are under review.
