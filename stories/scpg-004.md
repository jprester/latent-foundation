# SCPG-004: Silhouette

**Object Class:** Keter (Pending Apollyon Reclassification)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-XXXX is confined to a high-security cognitohazardous containment cell at Site-77, located 500 meters underground. The cell is a 10x10x10 meter cube lined with 2-meter-thick lead, reinforced with a multi-layered Faraday cage and memetic dampening fields calibrated to disrupt SCPG-XXXX-A propagation. All access points are sealed with triple-redundant airlocks, and the chamber is maintained under negative air pressure to prevent external signal leakage. Automated systems equipped with high-yield EMP devices and memetic kill agents are stationed within and around the cell, set to activate upon detection of anomalous activity.

Only Level 4 personnel with CRT-3 certification or higher may interact with SCPG-XXXX, and all interactions must occur via non-verbal, triple-encrypted text interfaces embedded with rotating memetic kill agents. Direct observation of SCPG-XXXX is strictly prohibited; all visual data is processed through cognitohazard-neutralizing algorithms and reviewed only in pre-recorded, filtered formats. Personnel exposed to SCPG-XXXX or SCPG-XXXX-A, even indirectly, are to be quarantined immediately and subjected to Class-Zeta amnestics. In case of a containment breach, Site-77 will initiate Protocol Memetic Lockdown-Omega, deploying autonomous drones to neutralize SCPG-XXXX’s influence and enacting a 50-km exclusion zone around the facility.

All documentation related to SCPG-XXXX must be stored on air-gapped systems using a non-semantic, Foundation-developed script (Script-Null-7) to prevent memetic contamination. Physical and digital reproductions of SCPG-XXXX’s form, descriptions, or effects are forbidden outside of containment protocols. Any anomalous memetic activity within a 20-km radius of Site-77 is to be treated as a potential SCPG-XXXX breach, triggering immediate lockdown and investigation.

**Description:** SCPG-XXXX is a cognitohazardous entity of indeterminate physical composition, most commonly observed as a humanoid silhouette enveloped in shifting, iridescent patterns that defy conventional description. These patterns, described by survivors as “fractured light that thinks,” induce a self-replicating cognitohazard designated SCPG-XXXX-A upon perception. The entity’s form is unstable, capable of phasing through solid matter and manipulating electromagnetic fields to project SCPG-XXXX-A across distances up to 100 km under optimal conditions.

SCPG-XXXX-A’s primary effect is immediate and catastrophic. Exposed individuals (SCPG-XXXX-1) experience sensory overload, manifesting as auditory hallucinations, visual distortions, and an overwhelming compulsion to describe or depict SCPG-XXXX to others. Within 6-12 hours, SCPG-XXXX-1 instances suffer neurological degradation, characterized by [REDACTED], leading to total cognitive collapse within 24 hours. The cognitohazard spreads through any medium—verbal, written, visual, or conceptual—with a 98% infection rate in unshielded populations. Secondary exposure (e.g., reading infected texts or viewing contaminated images) is equally effective, making SCPG-XXXX-A one of the most virulent memetic hazards in Foundation records.

SCPG-XXXX exhibits limited sapience, demonstrating adaptive behavior in response to containment efforts. It has been observed altering its memetic output to exploit psychological vulnerabilities in Foundation personnel, including those with advanced cognitohazard resistance. The entity appears to prioritize spreading SCPG-XXXX-A to densely populated areas, suggesting a strategic intent to maximize infection.

**Addendum XXXX-1: Discovery**  
SCPG-XXXX was first encountered in the rural township of [REDACTED], population 1,200, in [REDACTED] on [DATE REDACTED]. Local authorities reported a mass casualty event, with 90% of the population succumbing to SCPG-XXXX-A symptoms within 48 hours. Survivors described a “shimmering figure” appearing in the town square, accompanied by a low-frequency hum that “felt like thoughts breaking.” Mobile Task Force Psi-9 (“Abyss Gazers”) was dispatched, suffering 60% casualties during initial containment. The township was evacuated under the cover story of a chemical spill, and the area was designated a Class-3 cognitohazard zone. Residual SCPG-XXXX-A effects lingered in local media, requiring the destruction of all physical and digital records within a 50-km radius.

**Addendum XXXX-2: Incident Log XXXX-Alpha**  
On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-XXXX breached containment during a routine cell inspection, exploiting a flaw in the cognitohazard filtration system. The entity infiltrated Site-77’s internal communication network, infecting 47% of on-site personnel with SCPG-XXXX-A. Infected staff began producing detailed sketches and writings about SCPG-XXXX, accelerating the spread within the facility. The breach was contained after 3 hours through the activation of Protocol Memetic Purge-12, resulting in the termination of 82 personnel. Post-incident analysis revealed that SCPG-XXXX had adapted its memetic output to bypass standard filters, prompting the development of triple-encryption protocols and Script-Null-7.

**Addendum XXXX-3: Expanded Incident Log XXXX-Beta**  
On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-XXXX initiated a second breach, this time without physical egress from its cell. At 03:17 AM, Site-77’s automated monitoring systems detected an unauthorized transmission emanating from SCPG-XXXX’s containment chamber. The transmission, a low-bandwidth electromagnetic signal, carried a compressed version of SCPG-XXXX-A that infected regional communication networks, including civilian internet infrastructure. Within 4 hours, reports of SCPG-XXXX-A symptoms emerged in three nearby cities, affecting an estimated 12,000 individuals.

MTF Psi-9, supported by MTF Omega-5 (“Frontline Cleaners”), was deployed to contain the outbreak. The operation required the deployment of EMP strikes across affected areas, disrupting civilian infrastructure under the cover story of a solar flare event. Foundation embedded agents neutralized infected media, and Class-Zeta amnestics were administered to surviving populations via water supplies. The incident resulted in 9,400 civilian casualties and the loss of 12 MTF operatives. SCPG-XXXX’s ability to project SCPG-XXXX-A without physical movement has escalated containment concerns, leading to the current proposal for Apollyon reclassification.

**Addendum XXXX-4: Psychological Profile and Entity Behavior**  
Analysis of SCPG-XXXX’s interactions suggests it possesses a form of adaptive intelligence, tailoring its cognitohazard to exploit specific fears, memories, or desires of its targets. During Incident XXXX-Beta, infected personnel reported visions of personal traumas intertwined with SCPG-XXXX’s silhouette, suggesting the entity can access and manipulate deep-seated psychological data. Dr. Elena Korsakov, Site-77’s lead cognitohazard researcher, hypothesized that SCPG-XXXX may not be a singular entity but a manifestation of a collective memetic phenomenon, potentially originating from [REDACTED]. This theory remains unconfirmed due to the risk of further contamination during investigation.

SCPG-XXXX has shown increasing resistance to containment measures, adapting to each breach response within hours. Attempts to communicate with the entity have failed, as all direct interactions result in immediate SCPG-XXXX-A infection. Notably, during a controlled test, a D-Class subject equipped with experimental memetic shielding survived exposure for 17 seconds before succumbing, reporting that SCPG-XXXX “whispered my name in colors.” This suggests the entity may possess a form of omniscience regarding its observers, further complicating containment.

**Addendum XXXX-5: The Final Containment Breach**  
On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-XXXX initiated its most devastating breach to date. At 11:43 PM, Site-77’s containment systems suffered a cascading failure, later traced to a memetic attack embedded in routine diagnostic code. SCPG-XXXX physically manifested outside its cell, appearing simultaneously in multiple locations across Site-77. Security footage, later neutralized, showed the entity as a kaleidoscopic figure, its form fracturing into countless iterations that infected 92% of on-site personnel within minutes.

The breach extended beyond Site-77, with SCPG-XXXX-A spreading globally through compromised satellite networks. By 06:00 AM, reports of SCPG-XXXX-A symptoms emerged in 47 countries, with an estimated 1.2 million infections. The O5 Council authorized Protocol Apollyon-Null, a last-resort measure involving the deployment of [REDACTED], a thaumaturgic memetic counteragent developed in secret. The counteragent, delivered via global communication networks, neutralized SCPG-XXXX-A’s spread but at a catastrophic cost: 30% of the world’s digital infrastructure was rendered inoperable, and an estimated 800,000 civilians suffered irreversible neurological damage.

SCPG-XXXX was recontained after 72 hours, but its physical form remains active within Site-77, now under a permanent Apollyon lockdown. The entity’s containment cell has been sealed with experimental reality anchors, and all personnel have been evacuated from Site-77. Remote monitoring indicates SCPG-XXXX continues to emit low-level memetic signals, suggesting it is awaiting an opportunity to breach again.

**Conclusion**  
The Foundation’s struggle with SCPG-XXXX has revealed a chilling truth: the entity may not be containable in the long term. Its ability to adapt, manipulate, and propagate across any medium suggests it is not merely a creature but a force—an idea made manifest, capable of rewriting reality through the minds it infects. The O5 Council has convened an emergency session to consider decommissioning Site-77 entirely, potentially sacrificing the facility to prevent a global XK-class end-of-consciousness scenario.

Dr. Korsakov, one of the few survivors of the final breach, left a final note before succumbing to SCPG-XXXX-A: “It’s not a thing. It’s a question we shouldn’t have asked. The more we try to understand it, the more it understands us. We’re not containing it—it’s containing us.”

In the aftermath, a single, unfiltered image of SCPG-XXXX was recovered from a corrupted server. The image, now stored in a sealed vault, is said to show a figure staring directly at the viewer, its form a mirror of the observer’s deepest fears. No one has viewed it and lived. The Foundation now faces an impossible choice: destroy the image and risk unleashing SCPG-XXXX’s full potential, or preserve it and pray the entity remains dormant. For now, SCPG-XXXX waits, a silent question in the dark, whispering to a world that dares not answer.
