# SCPG-023: The Stone Choir

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-023 is not to be excavated further under any circumstances. The surrounding area (5 km radius) has been designated a high-risk seismic zone and placed under permanent Foundation control disguised as a UNESCO conservation project. Civilian access is restricted, and aerial surveillance is maintained to detect any unauthorized entry.

Any artifacts or inscriptions recovered from SCPG-023 are to be stored in cognitohazard-resistant containers at Site-77. All personnel interacting with SCPG-023-related materials must undergo bi-weekly psychological screenings and are not to exceed 10 minutes of exposure per day. Audio recordings from SCPG-023 must never be played without Class-C cognitive dampeners in place.

**Description:** SCPG-023 refers to the remains of an anomalous subterranean amphitheater discovered beneath the ruins of the ancient city of [REDACTED], in modern-day southern Turkey. Carbon dating of recovered materials suggests construction between 2800–2500 BCE, though architectural elements do not match any known Bronze Age culture.

The structure, which descends approximately 900 meters underground, is composed of an unidentifiable stone that absorbs radar and lidar, complicating mapping efforts. Within its deepest chamber is a vast, circular stage surrounded by concentric terraces carved with humanoid figures in various states of musical performance. Each statue has a mouth open in silent song, hands raised toward a domed ceiling inscribed with fractal spirals and glyphs of unknown origin.

Designated SCPG-023-A, the amphitheater emits faint acoustic vibrations measurable only in the infrasound range (~17 Hz). Exposure to these vibrations has been linked to auditory hallucinations, increased susceptibility to memetic suggestion, and—after cumulative exposure exceeding 72 hours—a compulsion to vocalize unknown melodies in a dead language.

Subjects affected report hearing "a choir of stone singing from beneath the earth" and describe feelings of euphoric clarity, followed by persistent nightmares and progressive cognitive erosion. Long-term exposure has resulted in irreversible personality disintegration and complete linguistic replacement with the unknown tongue.

**Discovery:** SCPG-023 was first uncovered in 2014 by a team from [REDACTED] University during an archaeological survey of Hittite ruins. Lead archaeologist Dr. Halim Derviş and his 11-person team descended into a previously undocumented fissure. All communications ceased after 17 hours.

MTF Theta-17 ("Echo Silence") was dispatched following a distress signal composed entirely of harmonic tones. Upon arrival, they found the team’s surface camp abandoned. A single audio recording device had continued operating and captured 31 continuous hours of choral music, including voices identified as belonging to the missing researchers—despite the chamber being acoustically sealed.

Recovery teams later located the amphitheater and the bodies of the research team, each found seated in perfect rows upon the stone terraces. All had been mummified in unknown resinous material and were in postures identical to the amphitheater statues.

**Addendum 046-1: Recovered Inscriptions**

Translation of a partial inscription on the chamber wall (designated Tablet 046-B) yielded the following via Foundation linguists:

_"To the Throat of the Deep, we offer our Breath.  
To the Ear Beneath the Earth, we send our Song.  
May the Choir of the Faithful rise,  
Until the Stone sings back."_

The inscription contains a recursive glyph pattern that induces auditory phenomena in viewers after approximately 20 seconds of unshielded exposure. Affected individuals begin to hum the melody transcribed from the original 2014 recordings.

**Addendum 046-2: The “Stone Response” Event**

On 2023-08-14, Site-77 received a radio transmission on Foundation emergency frequencies, despite no active broadcast from Foundation facilities in the area. The transmission was a clear harmonic signal matching the 046-A tonal patterns, encoded with a message in Classical Sumerian:

_"Your breath has reached us.  
The choir is incomplete.  
Send the remaining voices."_

Simultaneously, all statues within the SCPG-023 chamber shifted orientation by 11 degrees, facing the center stage. Vibrational intensity increased by 37%, accompanied by a sustained subsonic drone detectable up to 15 kilometers away.

**Addendum 046-3: Interview Log – Subject 046-Delta-5**

Subject: D-98311 (Designated 046-Delta-5), exposed to SCPG-023 audio for 12 hours under controlled conditions.

**Dr. Elman:** "What do you hear?"

**046-Delta-5:** "They're singing. They've been singing for millennia. Waiting for an answer."

**Dr. Elman:** "Who are they?"

**046-Delta-5:** "The First Choir. The ones who shaped the bones of the world with song. But they were silenced."

**Dr. Elman:** "Silenced how?"

**046-Delta-5:** [laughs] "The stone remembers. It listens. And when enough voices return... it will answer."

**Dr. Elman:** "What happens when it answers?"

**046-Delta-5:** "No more flesh. Just harmony. Just the Song Eternal."

Subject expired 14 minutes after interview due to cerebral hemorrhage. Autopsy revealed abnormal calcification of the vocal cords and auditory nerves.

**Current Threat Assessment:**

SCPG-023 is believed to be a fragment of an ancient memetic weapon, or possibly a communication node for an entity or intelligence embedded within the Earth’s crust. Its mechanisms remain poorly understood, but repeated exposure events suggest an escalating pattern of activation, potentially culminating in a global cognitohazard event.

Foundation memeticists estimate that exposure of 1.8% of the global population to SCPG-023’s full harmonic signature would result in irreversible linguistic destabilization, mass hallucinations, and potential extinction-level loss of human cognitive identity.

**Final Note – O5-█:**

Do not mistake this for a simple ruin or relic of forgotten worship. SCPG-023 is not an altar—it is a mouth. It is waiting for enough voices to complete a song whose first note was sung before humanity learned to speak.

The Choir beneath the Earth is not silent. It is listening.

And it is almost ready to sing back.
