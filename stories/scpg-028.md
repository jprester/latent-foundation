# The Mimic's Hunt

**Item #:** SCPG-028

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-028 is to be contained within a modified humanoid containment cell at Site-██, measuring 5m x 5m x 3m. The cell walls are to be constructed of reinforced concrete with embedded Faraday cage mesh to prevent potential electromagnetic anomalies. No reflective surfaces are permitted within the containment area.

The cell is to be monitored via thermal imaging cameras only. Standard optical surveillance equipment has proven unreliable due to SCPG-028's anomalous properties. Two (2) armed guards are to be stationed outside the containment area at all times, with mandatory rotation every four (4) hours to prevent psychological influence.

Interaction with SCPG-028 is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, and only under direct supervision of the Site Director. All personnel entering SCPG-028's containment area must undergo psychological evaluation before and after exposure. Any staff member reporting dreams, hallucinations, or intrusive thoughts following contact with SCPG-028 are to be administered Class-B amnestics and reassigned.

SCPG-028 is to be provided with standard humanoid nutrition three times daily through an automated feeding system. No direct human contact during feeding is permitted. In the event of a containment breach, Site-██ is to initiate Protocol Nightfall, sealing all exits and activating emergency lighting systems throughout the facility.

**Description:** SCPG-028 appears to be a Caucasian male of indeterminate age, approximately 1.8 meters in height with an average build. Physical examination has proven difficult due to SCPG-028's primary anomalous property: its appearance shifts subtly but consistently when observed, making detailed documentation challenging. These alterations include changes in facial features, hair color and length, eye color, and apparent age, typically occurring when the observer's attention is diverted for periods exceeding 2-3 seconds.

SCPG-028's most significant anomalous property is its ability to assume the physical appearance and mannerisms of individuals it has had prolonged exposure to, either through direct contact or detailed observation. This mimicry extends beyond simple visual replication and includes vocal patterns, behavioral tics, and apparent knowledge of personal information that SCPG-028 should not possess. The mechanism by which SCPG-028 acquires this information remains unknown.

Psychological evaluation suggests SCPG-028 possesses a sophisticated understanding of human psychology and demonstrates predatory behavior patterns consistent with antisocial personality disorder. The entity exhibits no empathy or remorse and appears to derive satisfaction from psychological manipulation and the infliction of fear in others.

SCPG-028 was initially contained following a series of murders in ████████, Oregon, between 20██ and 20██. Local law enforcement reported seventeen (17) confirmed victims, all found in their homes with no signs of forced entry. Witnesses provided conflicting descriptions of the suspected perpetrator, with some claiming the individual resembled deceased family members or close friends of the victims. Foundation agents embedded within the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit flagged the case for investigation after noting the anomalous witness testimonies.

**Discovery Log 4729-A:**

SCPG-028 was apprehended on ██/██/20██ following a coordinated effort between Foundation agents and local law enforcement. The entity was discovered in the home of its final victim, Ms. Sarah ████████, having assumed the appearance of her deceased husband. Agent Morrison's report noted that SCPG-028's disguise was "perfect in every detail" and that the entity had been living in the victim's home for an estimated three weeks prior to her death.

During initial containment, SCPG-028 cycled through the appearances of multiple individuals, including several of its victims and Agent Morrison himself. The entity demonstrated knowledge of personal details about Agent Morrison's family that had not been disclosed during their interaction, suggesting an unknown method of information acquisition.

**Addendum 4729-1: Interview Log**

**Interviewed:** SCPG-028

**Interviewer:** Dr. Elizabeth Hayes

**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Foreword:** This interview was conducted three weeks after initial containment to establish baseline behavioral patterns and assess the extent of SCPG-028's anomalous capabilities.

**Dr. Hayes:** Good morning. I'm Dr. Hayes. I'd like to ask you some questions.

**SCPG-028:** [Subject's appearance shifts to resemble Dr. Hayes] Good morning, Elizabeth. Though I suppose it's afternoon now, isn't it? You've been working late again. Your daughter called three times yesterday.

**Dr. Hayes:** How do you know about my daughter?

**SCPG-028:** [Laughs] The same way I knew about Sarah's fear of drowning. The same way I knew Marcus kept his father's watch in the nightstand. You people leave such obvious trails.

**Dr. Hayes:** What do you mean by 'trails'?

**SCPG-028:** [Appearance shifts to that of an unknown middle-aged man] Every person carries their history like a scent. Their fears, their loves, their secrets. It's all there if you know how to look. Your daughter's afraid you don't love her anymore since the divorce.

**Dr. Hayes:** We're not here to discuss my personal life.

**SCPG-028:** [Appearance shifts again, now resembling a young boy] But that's all there is, isn't it? Personal lives. Personal fears. I become what people need to see, and they let me in. They always let me in.

**Dr. Hayes:** How long have you been able to do this?

**SCPG-028:** [Appearance returns to original form] Time is... fluid. I remember faces from decades ago as clearly as yesterday. Sometimes I forget which face was originally mine.

**Dr. Hayes:** Do you feel remorse for what you've done?

**SCPG-028:** [Pauses] Do you feel remorse for swatting a fly? These people... they're so fragile, so desperate to believe in something. I simply gave them what they wanted to see until I didn't need to anymore.

**Dr. Hayes:** That's enough for today.

**SCPG-028:** [As Dr. Hayes stands to leave] Give my regards to your daughter, Elizabeth. Tell her Mommy's thinking about her.

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Hayes was administered Class-B amnestics following this interview and reassigned to SCP-████. SCPG-028 demonstrated knowledge of personal information that Dr. Hayes confirmed she had not disclosed to anyone at the Foundation. Investigation into potential information breaches yielded no results.

**Addendum 4729-2: Incident Report 4729-Alpha**

**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Incident:** During routine feeding, Security Guard James Patterson reported seeing his deceased brother through SCPG-028's cell window. Patterson attempted to override the containment door locks and was restrained by backup security. SCPG-028 was observed maintaining the appearance of Patterson's brother for approximately forty-seven minutes following the incident.

**Note:** Guard Patterson had not disclosed information about his deceased brother to Foundation personnel. Family records confirmed that Patterson's brother had died in a vehicle accident six months prior to Patterson's employment at Site-██. Patterson was administered Class-A amnestics and transferred to a different site.

**Addendum 4729-3: Research Notes by Dr. Marcus Webb**

**Date:** ██/██/20██

Following extensive observation and testing, I believe SCPG-028's anomalous abilities extend beyond simple shapeshifting. The entity appears to possess some form of psychometric ability, allowing it to extract information from individuals through unknown means. This may explain how it acquires detailed personal information about its targets and their associates.

Of particular concern is SCPG-028's apparent ability to maintain multiple "identities" simultaneously. During recent observations, the entity has been seen talking to itself in different voices, suggesting it may be role-playing conversations with previous victims or assumed identities. The psychological implications of this behavior require further study.

I recommend upgrading SCPG-028's classification to Keter, as its manipulation abilities pose a significant risk to personnel security and containment integrity. The entity's intelligence and adaptability make it extremely dangerous in any scenario involving human contact.

**Addendum 4729-4: Incident Report 4729-Beta**

**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Incident:** At 0347 hours, Site-██ experienced a total power failure lasting approximately twelve minutes. During this time, SCPG-028's containment cell door was found open, though security footage from the backup generators showed no evidence of the entity leaving its cell. When power was restored, SCPG-028 was found in its normal position, but appeared to be wearing Dr. Webb's clothing and ID badge.

Investigation revealed that Dr. Webb was found unconscious in his office, wearing what appeared to be standard Foundation prisoner attire. Dr. Webb claimed no memory of the incident and insisted he had been in his office working on research notes all evening. However, the research notes found on his desk were written in a different handwriting style and contained detailed information about SCPG-028's containment procedures that Dr. Webb should not have had access to.

**Status:** Dr. Webb was placed under observation for 72 hours and subjected to extensive psychological evaluation. All tests returned normal results. The mechanism by which SCPG-028 apparently exchanged positions with Dr. Webb remains unknown. Dr. Webb has been reassigned pending further investigation.

**Addendum 4729-5: Updated Containment Protocols**

**Date:** ██/██/20██

Following Incident 4729-Beta, the following additional containment measures have been implemented:

1. All personnel assigned to SCPG-028 must undergo daily identity verification using biometric scanners.

2. SCPG-028's containment cell has been equipped with motion sensors and pressure plates to detect any unauthorized movement.

3. A dead man's switch has been installed that will trigger Site-wide lockdown if SCPG-028's biometric signature is detected outside its containment area.

4. All research materials related to SCPG-028 are to be stored in a separate facility to prevent information compromise.

**Note from Site Director ████:** The events surrounding SCPG-028 suggest we may be dealing with an entity whose capabilities extend far beyond our current understanding. Until we can determine the full extent of its anomalous properties, extreme caution is advised. Under no circumstances should SCPG-028 be underestimated or treated as a standard humanoid anomaly.

**Addendum 4729-6: Psychological Profile Update**

**Date:** ██/██/20██

**Prepared by:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief of Psychiatric Research

After reviewing all available data on SCPG-028, I must express serious concerns about our current containment approach. The entity demonstrates a level of psychological sophistication that suggests it may be manipulating us in ways we haven't yet recognized.

SCPG-028's behavior patterns indicate a predator that has refined its hunting techniques over an extended period. Its ability to assume the identities of emotionally significant individuals suggests it targets victims' psychological vulnerabilities with surgical precision. The fact that it can acquire detailed personal information through unknown means makes it exceptionally dangerous to Foundation personnel.

I strongly recommend that all future interactions with SCPG-028 be conducted remotely, with no direct human contact. The entity's influence appears to extend beyond its immediate physical presence, as evidenced by the recurring psychological effects experienced by exposed personnel.

**Classification Review:** Following comprehensive analysis of SCPG-028's capabilities and the security breaches associated with its containment, I am formally recommending reclassification to Keter status. The entity's unpredictable nature, combined with its apparent ability to influence personnel and potentially breach containment through unknown means, represents an unacceptable risk to Site security and personnel safety.

**Final Note:** As of ██/██/20██, SCPG-028 has been observed maintaining the appearance of various Foundation personnel for extended periods, including individuals it has never directly encountered. The implications of this development are currently under investigation. All staff are reminded to report any unusual behavior or unexplained knowledge displayed by colleagues immediately.

The hunt never truly ends; it simply changes form.
