# SCPG-024: Lets play a game

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-024 is contained within a Leidenfrost Layer Containment Chamber (LLCC) located at Site-87. The LLCC is a spherical vacuum chamber measuring 25 meters in diameter with a surface composed of a specialized nickel-chromium alloy capable of maintaining a Leidenfrost layer at temperatures exceeding 2000°C. Access to the LLCC is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher.

Due to the ongoing risk of a CK-Class restructuring event, a perimeter of 10 kilometers around Site-87 has been established as a restricted access zone, patrolled by Foundation security teams equipped with thermal imaging and gamma radiation detectors. Any civilian incursions into this area are to be intercepted and subjects administered amnestic treatment.

In the event of a containment breach, Protocol Tartarus-187 is to be initiated immediately. This involves the deployment of a specialized containment team equipped with high-temperature resistant hazmat suits and portable cooling units. Their primary objective is to re-establish the Leidenfrost layer and return SCPG-024 to the LLCC. Failing that, Protocol Tartarus-187 authorizes the use of high-yield thermobaric munitions to destabilize SCP-XXXX's internal structure and mitigate the threat of a CK-Class event.

**Description:** SCPG-024 is a self-sustaining, highly energetic anomalous phenomenon manifesting as a children's playground constructed from an unknown superheated metallic alloy. The exact composition of this alloy remains undetermined, as direct sampling has proven impossible due to its extreme temperature, estimated to exceed 2500°C.

The playground itself consists of standard playground equipment such as swing sets, seesaws, monkey bars, and a large spiraling slide structure. However, these components are in a constant state of fluctuation, their shapes and positions shifting and rearranging in an unpredictable, almost organic manner. This kinetic activity appears to be driven by intense thermal energy radiating from SCP-XXXX's core, which resembles a miniature sun or plasma torus.

Individuals within a 50-meter radius of SCPG-024 are subjected to auditory and visual hallucinations consistent with childhood memories or trauma. These hallucinations grow increasingly vivid and distressing the closer one gets to SCP-XXXX, often culminating in psychotic breaks or uncontrolled violent behavior.

While the origin of SCPG-024 is unknown, it is theorized that it may be an unintended byproduct of an experiment or reality restructuring event gone awry. Its highly unstable nature and potential to initiate a CK-Class restructuring scenario make it one of the most dangerous anomalies currently contained by the Foundation.

**Addendum XXXX-1:** Incident Log 05/23/20██

At approximately 0315 hours, a breach occurred in the LLCC housing SCPG-024 due to a critical systems failure. Within minutes, SCPG-024 had destabilized and begun rapidly expanding in size, its constituent metallic components liquefying and reforming into larger and more complex playground structures.

By 0400 hours, SCPG-024 had grown to over 200 meters in diameter and its thermal output had increased exponentially, raising surface temperatures within a 5-kilometer radius to over 300°C. Civilian populations in nearby towns began reporting symptoms consistent with SCP-XXXX's psychoactive effects, including episodes of mania, hallucinations, and violent outbursts.

Protocol Tartarus-187 was initiated, and a containment team was deployed to reestablish the Leidenfrost layer. However, their efforts were unsuccessful, as SCP-XXXX's intensifying heat had rendered conventional cooling methods ineffective.

At 0529 hours, SCPG-024 underwent a catastrophic energy surge, resulting in a localized distortion of space-time. A miniature black hole formed at its core, rapidly accreting matter from the surrounding area. Within seconds, Site-87 and all personnel present were consumed.

The ensuing gravitational shockwave triggered a CK-Class restructuring event, the full extent of which is still being assessed by the Foundation's Metaphysics Department. Current projections indicate that numerous civilian population centers have been affected by residual space-time anomalies, necessitating ongoing intervention and administration of amnestic compounds on a massive scale.
