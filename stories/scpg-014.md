# SCPG-014: The Gardener's Companion

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-014 is to be kept in a standard Secure anomalous object locker at Site-42's Low-Risk Anomalies Wing. Once per week, SCPG-014 is to be removed from its locker and placed in contact with any common, non-anomalous potted plant for a period of no less than one (1) hour to maintain its quiescent state. Standard Level 1 personnel are sufficient for this task.

No other specific containment procedures are required. Accidental exposure to SCPG-014 by unauthorized personnel is not considered a containment breach, though standard anomalous object handling protocols should be followed.

**Description:** SCPG-014 is a small, smooth, grey stone, ovoid in shape, approximately 8 cm in length and 5 cm at its widest point. It is warm to the touch, maintaining a constant surface temperature of approximately 30°C, regardless of ambient temperature. Spectrographic and material analysis have been inconclusive, revealing no unusual elements but an unidentifiable crystalline lattice structure.

SCPG-014's anomalous properties manifest when it is placed in direct physical contact with soil containing living plant matter. Upon contact, the following effects are observed:

- **Accelerated Growth and Health:** Plants in proximity to SCPG-014 exhibit significantly accelerated growth rates, often 2-3 times the norm for their species. They also display enhanced vitality, increased resistance to disease and pests, and more vibrant coloration. Fruit-bearing plants produce larger, more numerous, and reportedly more flavorful yields.
- **Soil Enrichment:** The soil surrounding SCPG-014 becomes demonstrably enriched with nutrients essential for plant life, even if initially barren or depleted. The mechanism for this nutrient generation is unknown.
- **Benign "Guidance":** Plants appear to grow in a more optimal manner, e.g., vines will naturally find supports, roots will avoid obstacles, and foliage will arrange itself for maximum light exposure without direct intervention. This effect is subtle and appears to be non-coercive.
- **Calming Effect (Anecdotal):** Personnel handling SCPG-014 or working in its vicinity for extended periods have reported feelings of calm, reduced stress, and a general sense of well-being. This effect is mild and has not been conclusively proven to be anomalous, but is consistently reported.

SCPG-014 exhibits no sentience in the conventional sense, though it responds predictably to the presence of plant life. It does not react to animal life or inorganic materials beyond its constant temperature. If deprived of contact with living plants for more than two (2) weeks, SCPG-014's surface temperature will gradually decrease to match ambient levels, and its beneficial effects will cease until contact is re-established. It has never displayed any hostile or harmful properties.

**Addendum 012-1: Discovery**
SCPG-014 was recovered on ██/██/20██ from the garden of Mrs. Agnes Periwinkle (aged 87) in [REDACTED], Vermont, after local agricultural officials noted her small suburban garden was producing crop yields and floral displays far exceeding any reasonable expectation, despite her advanced age and minimal horticultural intervention. Mrs. Periwinkle claimed the stone was a "good luck charm" her late husband had found in their backyard "many years ago" and that she always kept it near her prize-winning roses. She willingly surrendered the object to Foundation agents (disguised as university researchers studying unique geological formations) in exchange for a lifetime supply of her favorite brand of tea and a new set of gardening gloves. Mrs. Periwinkle reported no anomalous effects herself, beyond "always feeling peaceful" in her garden.

**Addendum 012-2: Testing Log Excerpt**

- **Test 012-04:** SCPG-014 placed in a terrarium with several species of endangered mosses known for difficult cultivation. Within 72 hours, all specimens showed vigorous new growth. Within two weeks, propagation rates exceeded baseline projections by 250%.
- **Test 012-07:** SCPG-014 introduced to a sample of Martian regolith simulant. After 24 hours of contact, trace amounts of organic compounds and nitrates, not present in the original simulant, were detected. Further research into potential terraforming applications is pending Level 3 approval.
- **Test 012-11:** D-Class personnel with a history of anxiety disorders instructed to perform routine gardening tasks (potting, watering) in a room containing SCPG-014 and several plants for one hour daily for one week. Subject reported a noticeable decrease in anxiety symptoms. Physiological markers (heart rate, cortisol levels) showed a statistically significant reduction compared to control sessions without SCPG-014.

**Researcher's Note - Dr. Eleanor Vance:**
"SCPG-014 is, frankly, a delight. In an organization that deals with so many existential threats and horrors, it's refreshing to encounter an anomaly that simply... helps things grow. Its potential applications in agriculture, ecological restoration, and even potentially long-duration space travel (pending the regolith test results) are considerable. It serves as a good reminder that not all anomalies are malevolent. Sometimes, the universe just produces something nice."
