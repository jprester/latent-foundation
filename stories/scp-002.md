# SCP-002: The Living Room

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-002 is contained on-site due to its immobile nature. The building containing SCP-002 has been purchased by the Foundation and converted into Site-██. A perimeter of 200m is to be maintained around the building.

**Description:** SCP-002 resembles a furnished apartment living room, complete with period-appropriate furniture from the 1970s. The room measures exactly 4.2m × 3.8m and contains a sofa, coffee table, television set, and bookshelf filled with various novels.

When a human subject enters SCP-002 and remains for more than 12 minutes, they will report feeling "extremely comfortable" and express reluctance to leave. Subjects who remain for more than 30 minutes become unable to perceive the exit door, effectively trapping them within the space.

**Addendum 002-A:** Recovered furniture from SCP-002 contains traces of human DNA from at least 47 different individuals. Investigation ongoing.
