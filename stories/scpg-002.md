# SCPG-009: The Blackwood Estate

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-009 is contained on-site due to its immobile nature and the catastrophic risks associated with attempted relocation. The Blackwood Estate and surrounding 50-hectare property have been acquired by the Foundation under the cover identity of "Heritage Preservation Society." A 5-kilometer exclusion zone has been established around the property, monitored by Mobile Task Force Theta-4 ("Gardeners").

Under no circumstances are personnel to enter SCPG-009 between the hours of 11:47 PM and 12:13 AM local time (designated "The Silence"). Any personnel who fail to exit SCPG-009 before 11:47 PM are to be considered lost and presumed integrated into SCPG-009-Φ (see Addendum 009-4).

All research within SCPG-009 must be conducted using remote drones or D-Class personnel equipped with quantum entanglement communicators. Personnel entering SCPG-009 are limited to 6-hour exposure periods and must undergo immediate temporal displacement screening upon exit. Any individual showing signs of "chronological drift" (aging inconsistencies of ±6 months) is to be quarantined indefinitely.

The Foundation maintains a cover story involving "structural instability due to subsidence" to deter civilian investigation. Local authorities have been informed that the property is contaminated with asbestos and other hazardous materials.

**Description:** SCPG-009 is a three-story Victorian mansion constructed in 1847 by industrialist Cornelius Blackwood in ████████, Massachusetts. The building exhibits significant temporal anomalies, with the interior space demonstrating non-Euclidean geometry and rooms that appear to exist in different time periods simultaneously.

The mansion contains approximately 47 rooms across its three floors, though this number fluctuates between 43 and 52 depending on the time of observation. Room layouts, furniture, and decorative elements shift periodically, often reflecting different historical periods from 1847 to 2156 CE. Most concerning are rooms that appear to be from timeline variants where human civilization developed differently or not at all.

SCPG-009's primary anomalous effect is its function as a temporal nexus point. The building exists simultaneously across multiple timelines and appears to serve as an observation post for entities designated SCPG-009-A. These entities manifest as translucent humanoid figures dressed in period-appropriate clothing from various eras, though some wear garments of unknown design suggesting non-terrestrial or far-future origins.

**SCPG-009-A Entities:**
The "residents" of SCPG-009 appear to be conscious entities capable of limited interaction with Foundation personnel. They demonstrate awareness of different timelines and frequently make references to events that have not occurred in our reality. Analysis suggests these entities may be iterations of the Blackwood family from alternate timelines, though some specimens appear to be entirely non-human in origin.

Most SCPG-009-A entities ignore Foundation personnel, going about daily routines appropriate to their apparent time period. However, certain entities (designated SCPG-009-A-Prime) actively seek contact with intruders and attempt to communicate warnings about "The Convergence."

**Addendum 009-1: Discovery**
SCPG-009 came to Foundation attention following reports of "impossible architecture" from urban explorers who infiltrated the abandoned property in 20██. Initial reports described rooms filled with furniture from different eras, paintings that moved when not directly observed, and voices speaking in languages "that hadn't been invented yet."

Foundation investigation revealed the property had been abandoned since 1924, following what local records describe as the "Blackwood Incident" - the simultaneous disappearance of all family members during a dinner party attended by 23 guests. No trace of the family or guests was ever found, despite the dining room table being discovered set for dinner with food still warm on the plates.

**Addendum 009-2: Initial Exploration Log - Dr. Sarah Chen**
_Note: The following is excerpted from Dr. Chen's exploration report dated ██/██/20██_

**12:30 PM - Ground Floor Entry**
Entered through main foyer. Architecture appears consistent with Victorian-era construction. Noted several anachronisms: electric lighting fixtures that predate electrical wiring in the area, and wallpaper patterns that match designs not created until the 1960s.

**12:45 PM - Drawing Room**
Encountered first SCPG-009-A entity: elderly woman in 1920s attire, seated by fireplace reading newspaper. Headline visible: "MARS COLONY CELEBRATES 50TH ANNIVERSARY." When approached, entity looked up and stated, "You're early. The appointment isn't until next century." Entity then resumed reading as if I weren't present.

**1:15 PM - Kitchen**
Kitchen layout impossible - appears to extend approximately 30 meters despite external measurements indicating maximum possible length of 12 meters. Found dinner table set for 47 people, despite historical records indicating only 23 guests at the Blackwood Incident. Food appears fresh but steam rising from dishes forms patterns resembling star charts.

**1:30 PM - Second Floor Landing**
_[STATIC - TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT DETECTED]_

**3:17 PM - Master Bedroom (?)**
_Note: 1 hour 47 minutes unaccounted for. Dr. Chen's equipment shows no gap in recording, but timestamps indicate impossible duration._

Found myself in unfamiliar room decorated in style I cannot identify. Furniture appears to be grown rather than constructed. SCPG-009-A entity present: tall humanoid with elongated limbs, wearing robe covered in moving constellation patterns. Entity gestured toward window.

Outside view showed not the Massachusetts countryside, but what appeared to be Earth from orbit. Continents were wrong - arrangements I didn't recognize. Multiple moons visible in sky. Entity spoke without moving mouth: "Every choice creates a path. Every path needs watchers. We are the watchers. You are becoming one of us."

**[TRANSMISSION ENDS - DR. CHEN EXTRACTED BY MTF THETA-4]**

**Addendum 009-3: Incident 009-Alpha - The Convergence Event**
On ██/██/20██ at 11:47 PM, SCPG-009 experienced what researchers now classify as a "Convergence Event." All monitoring equipment within the mansion simultaneously began receiving transmissions from alternate versions of Foundation sites across multiple timelines.

Dr. ████████ from Timeline-Φ-447 reported via quantum communicator that their version of SCPG-009 had "opened completely" and was allowing unrestricted travel between timeline variants. Multiple versions of himself from different realities were conducting the same research, all reaching the same terrifying conclusion:

SCPG-009 is not an anomaly - it is a naturally occurring structure that exists in all timelines where the Blackwood family settled in that location. The entities within are not ghosts or temporal echoes, but conscious observers tasked with monitoring the development of human civilization across infinite reality variants.

The Convergence Event lasted 26 minutes. During this time, personnel reported seeing "impossible visitors" - versions of themselves from other timelines, some barely recognizable as human. Several D-Class personnel attempted to follow these visitors through doorways that led to other realities, and were lost.

**Addendum 009-4: SCPG-009-Φ Integration Protocol**
Following extended research, it has been determined that prolonged exposure to SCPG-009 results in "timeline integration" - affected individuals become SCPG-009-A entities, existing simultaneously across multiple realities while retaining partial awareness of their original timeline.

Agent ████ Rodriguez, lost during the Convergence Event, has been observed as an SCPG-009-A entity in subsequent explorations. When contacted, Rodriguez reported that he is simultaneously living in 1,847 different versions of reality, all slightly different. He described his existence as "being a single note played across an infinite symphony."

Rodriguez's reports indicate that the Blackwood family did not disappear in 1924 - they underwent forced integration with SCPG-009-Φ when they discovered the mansion's true purpose. According to Rodriguez, Cornelius Blackwood built the mansion on a "convergence point" after receiving instructions from entities he believed were angels, but which were actually previous integrated observers from other timelines.

**Addendum 009-5: The Watchers' Purpose**
Through communication with integrated personnel and cooperative SCPG-009-A entities, researchers have learned that SCPG-009 serves as one of countless observation posts monitoring human development across the multiverse. The observers are tasked with identifying timelines where humanity develops in ways that pose threats to the "Greater Structure" - a cosmic framework maintaining reality itself.

Dr. ████████ Blackwood (integrated 1924) explained during a séance-like communication session: "Some versions of your species discover things they shouldn't. Technologies that unravel the foundations of existence. We watch for the danger signs. When a timeline becomes too dangerous, it gets... edited."

When asked what constitutes "too dangerous," Blackwood's response chilled the research team: "You're asking the wrong question. The right question is: why do you think your timeline is still here?"

**Addendum 009-6: Escalation to Apollyon Classification**
Recent evidence suggests SCPG-009 is not merely monitoring timelines but actively selecting which versions of reality continue to exist. Foundation researchers across multiple timeline variants have confirmed that realities where certain discoveries are made (particularly regarding [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]) systematically cease to exist.

Dr. Rodriguez, during his most recent communication, delivered a message that prompted immediate reclassification: "The watchers are failing. Too many timelines are developing too fast. The Convergence isn't meant to last 26 minutes - it's meant to be permanent. When it happens again, all timelines collapse into one. The observers become the observed. Reality becomes... concentrated."

**Current Threat Assessment:**
SCPG-009 represents a potential XK-Class End-of-World scenario not just for our timeline, but for all possible versions of reality. The mansion serves as a control node in a multiversal monitoring system that may be preparing to "correct" the timeline proliferation by forcibly merging all realities into a single, manageable variant.

Foundation resources are currently focused on preventing the next Convergence Event while attempting to understand the Greater Structure that SCPG-009 serves. However, according to integrated personnel, every attempt to study or contain SCPG-009 merely accelerates the timeline toward permanent convergence.

**Final Note - O5-Council Emergency Session █████:**
The Blackwood Estate has revealed humanity's most terrifying discovery: we are not alone in the multiverse, and we are being watched. Worse, we may be approaching a cosmic deadline we never knew existed. The question is no longer how to contain SCPG-009, but whether our timeline deserves to survive the evaluation it represents.

The watchers in the mansion claim to be humanity's guardians, protecting reality from our own dangerous potential. But they may have forgotten that guardians can become wardens, and salvation can become extinction.

_As of this writing, 847 personnel have been integrated into SCPG-009-Φ. Each reports the same message: "The appointment is almost here."_
