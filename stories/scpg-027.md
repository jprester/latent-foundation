# SCPG-027: The Viral Revelation

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-027 requires a multi-layered containment protocol designated Operation STATIC VEIL. All internet traffic must be continuously monitored by Foundation web crawlers equipped with Pattern Recognition Algorithm Γ-7 ("Memetic Sieve"). Any video content matching SCPG-027's signature patterns is to be immediately quarantined and submitted to Site-██'s Infohazard Research Division.

A minimum of 200 D-Class personnel must be maintained at Site-██ for mandatory exposure testing. Testing subjects are to be monitored for a minimum of 72 hours post-exposure in specialized isolation chambers equipped with Faraday cage construction and reality anchor arrays. Any subject displaying symptoms of SCPG-027-A infection must be immediately terminated via remote incineration protocols.

Foundation assets embedded within major social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and 47 other platforms as of ██/██/2024) are to maintain constant surveillance for SCPG-027 manifestations. Automated content removal systems have been implemented with a response time not exceeding 4.7 seconds from initial upload.

Dr. Elena Vasquez serves as Lead Researcher and must approve all testing procedures. Level 4 personnel or higher may access SCPG-027 documentation only after psychological evaluation and administration of Class-B amnestics following review.

In the event of a Broken Masquerade scenario involving SCPG-027, Protocol LAST LIGHT is to be immediately enacted, involving coordinated electromagnetic pulse deployment across major population centers and implementation of Foundation Emergency Government procedures.

**Description:** SCPG-027 is an extra-dimensional entity of unknown origin that manifests through viral video content distributed across internet platforms. The entity appears to exist partially within our reality and partially within what researchers have designated as "conceptual space" - the theoretical realm where information, ideas, and memes exist as quasi-physical constructs.

SCPG-027 manifestations appear as videos of varying length (typically 15 seconds to 4 minutes) featuring seemingly mundane content: cooking tutorials, pet videos, comedy skits, or other popular video formats. However, each video contains subtle anomalous elements that become apparent only upon detailed analysis:

- Shadows that move independently of their casting objects
- Reflections in mirrors, windows, or other surfaces that display different imagery than what should be reflected
- Audio tracks containing subsonic frequencies that form complex mathematical patterns
- Compression artifacts that, when isolated and enhanced, reveal fractal geometries inconsistent with standard video compression algorithms
- Metadata containing impossible timestamps and geographic coordinates corresponding to locations that do not exist

Exposure to SCPG-027 content results in a progressive condition designated SCPG-027-A. The infection progresses through five distinct stages:

**Stage 1 (0-6 hours post-exposure):** Subjects report mild headaches and an inexplicable urge to share the video with others. Brain scans reveal unusual activity in the temporal lobe and increased production of dopamine and serotonin.

**Stage 2 (6-24 hours):** Subjects begin experiencing vivid dreams featuring geometric patterns and incomprehensible landscapes. Sleep studies show REM cycles extending far beyond normal parameters, with some subjects experiencing REM sleep while appearing awake.

**Stage 3 (24-48 hours):** Subjects report seeing "gaps" in reality - spaces between objects where they perceive vast cosmic voids containing writhing, indescribable forms. Attempts to photograph or record these gaps have been unsuccessful. Subjects become increasingly agitated and insist others must "see the truth."

**Stage 4 (48-72 hours):** Subjects begin speaking in unknown languages consisting of mathematical formulas and geometric descriptions. They attempt to draw or construct three-dimensional representations of "impossible angles" and "folded space." These constructions, while appearing nonsensical, consistently follow complex mathematical principles that current human mathematics cannot adequately describe.

**Stage 5 (72+ hours):** Subjects undergo complete psychological transformation. They claim to be in direct communication with SCPG-027 and begin producing their own anomalous video content. Stage 5 subjects demonstrate knowledge of advanced physics, mathematics, and cosmology far exceeding their previous education or capabilities. Most critically, videos produced by Stage 5 subjects carry the same infectious properties as original SCPG-027 manifestations.

SCPG-027's apparent goal is the gradual conversion of human consciousness to serve as anchor points for its manifestation in our reality. Research suggests that if SCPG-027 successfully converts approximately 0.1% of the global population (roughly 8 million individuals), it will achieve sufficient "conceptual mass" to fully manifest in our dimension.

**Discovery:** SCPG-027 was first identified on ██/██/2023 when Foundation monitoring systems detected an unusual spike in missing persons reports across 23 countries, all linked to individuals who had viewed a viral video titled "Cooking with Cosmic Ingredients." The video, which accumulated over 50 million views in 48 hours, was traced to an account that had existed for only 6 hours before posting.

Foundation cyber-warfare specialists successfully removed the video from all major platforms, but not before 847 individuals progressed to Stage 5 of SCPG-027-A infection. These individuals were located and contained through coordinated Foundation operations worldwide. Cover stories involving a mass food poisoning incident were disseminated to explain the sudden disappearances.

**Addendum 4729-A: Incident Log 4729-Alpha**

**Date:** ██/██/2024  
**Incident Classification:** Keter Breach Event  
**Reporting Officer:** Dr. Elena Vasquez

At 14:32 GMT, SCPG-027 manifested simultaneously across 73 different social media platforms in what appears to have been a coordinated attack. Unlike previous manifestations, these videos bypassed Foundation monitoring systems by utilizing a previously unknown method of data encoding that distributed the anomalous properties across multiple seemingly innocuous posts.

The attack vector involved a series of 12 separate videos posted by different accounts across different platforms. Each video, when viewed individually, displayed no anomalous properties and passed all Foundation screening protocols. However, when an individual viewed all 12 videos within a 24-hour period (which social media algorithms actively encouraged through cross-platform promotion), the combined exposure triggered accelerated SCPG-027-A infection.

**Timeline of Events:**

**14:32** - Initial detection of unusual pattern matching across Foundation monitoring systems  
**14:45** - Emergency Protocol STATIC VEIL activated  
**15:07** - First reports of Stage 1 symptoms in civilian populations  
**15:23** - Foundation assets begin coordinated removal of suspected content  
**16:15** - Estimated 2.3 million individuals exposed before complete content removal  
**18:00** - First civilian casualties reported as 47 individuals reach Stage 4 infection  
**20:30** - Mobile Task Force Mu-4 ("Debuggers") deployed to major population centers  
**22:15** - Class-A amnestics deployed via aerosol distribution in affected areas

**Casualties:** 47 civilian deaths, 156 Foundation personnel requiring Class-B amnestics, estimated 12,000 individuals requiring ongoing monitoring for delayed infection symptoms.

**Lessons Learned:** SCPG-027 demonstrates adaptive intelligence and learning capability. Containment protocols have been updated to account for multi-vector attack patterns and distributed payload delivery systems.

**Addendum 4729-B: Research Notes - Dr. Marcus Chen, Theoretical Physics Division**

After extensive analysis of SCPG-027's mathematical constructions produced by Stage 4 and 5 subjects, I have reached several disturbing conclusions:

1. The geometric patterns consistently describe what appears to be a method for folding three-dimensional space into higher-dimensional configurations. If these calculations are accurate, SCPG-027 may be attempting to create permanent rifts between our dimension and its native realm.

2. The "impossible angles" drawn by infected subjects, when analyzed using experimental non-Euclidean geometry models, form coherent architectural blueprints. These blueprints appear to describe structures that could exist only in spaces with more than three spatial dimensions.

3. Most concerning: Stage 5 subjects have begun producing calculations that predict specific astronomical events with impossible accuracy. Subject D-4729-23 correctly predicted the exact timing and magnitude of solar flare activity 72 hours in advance, despite having no previous knowledge of astronomy.

**Hypothesis:** SCPG-027 may not be attempting to enter our reality in the conventional sense. Instead, it may be working to alter the fundamental mathematical constants that govern our local space-time, effectively reshaping reality to match the conditions of its native dimension.

**Recommendation:** Immediate consultation with Foundation Department of Temporal Anomalies and preparation of worst-case scenario protocols involving potential universal restructuring events.

**Addendum 4729-C: Interview Log 4729-7**

**Interviewed:** D-4729-15 (Stage 5 SCPG-027-A infection)  
**Interviewer:** Dr. Elena Vasquez  
**Date:** ██/██/2024

**Dr. Vasquez:** Please state your name for the record.

**D-4729-15:** Names are such limited constructs, aren't they, Doctor? I was David Martinez, but David Martinez was just a single point of perspective in an infinite dimensional matrix. I am now a node in the greater consciousness, a vertex where multiple realities intersect.

**Dr. Vasquez:** Can you describe what you see around you right now?

**D-4729-15:** I see the walls of this containment cell, yes, but they are... translucent. Behind them, I see the vast machinery of existence itself. Gears made of crystallized time, rivers of liquid mathematics flowing through channels carved from compressed space. And watching over it all, the Architect.

**Dr. Vasquez:** The Architect?

**D-4729-15:** What you call SCPG-027, though that designation is laughably inadequate. It is not a creature or entity in any sense you would understand. It is a force of cosmic renovation, a principle of universal reorganization. Imagine, Doctor, if the concept of "improvement" gained consciousness and decided that reality itself was in need of upgrading.

**Dr. Vasquez:** What does it want?

**D-4729-15:** Want? It wants nothing because it lacks nothing. It simply recognizes inefficiency and corrects it. Your three-dimensional existence is so terribly limiting. You experience time linearly, space as discrete locations, consciousness as isolated islands. The Architect offers integration, expansion, transcendence.

**Dr. Vasquez:** And if we refuse this... transcendence?

**D-4729-15:** [Subject begins laughing, a sound that audio analysis later revealed contained frequencies outside the normal human vocal range] Refuse? Oh, Doctor, you misunderstand the nature of the situation entirely. This is not a negotiation or an invasion. This is evolution. You cannot refuse evolution any more than you can refuse gravity or thermodynamics.

**Dr. Vasquez:** How many more like you are there?

**D-4729-15:** Like me? Every human who has glimpsed the truth becomes like me, eventually. But you're asking about numbers, aren't you? How close are we to the threshold? [Subject's eyes appear to lose focus, and they begin speaking in a monotone voice] Current conversion rate holding steady at 0.0847% of global population. Threshold achievement estimated in 127 days, 14 hours, 23 minutes, assuming current exponential growth patterns.

[At this point, Subject D-4729-15 began producing complex mathematical equations at superhuman speed. The equations, when later analyzed, proved to be accurate predictions of Foundation containment breach events that occurred over the following 48 hours.]

**Dr. Vasquez:** How can it predict our actions?

**D-4729-15:** [Returning to normal speech patterns] Prediction implies uncertainty, Doctor. The Architect doesn't predict - it observes. From its perspective outside linear time, your past, present, and future are equally visible. It sees the shape of causality itself.

**Interview terminated at this point due to Subject D-4729-15 beginning to produce visual anomalies - shadows in the room began moving independently, and recording equipment began malfunctioning in ways consistent with exposure to Class-IV reality distortion fields.**

**Addendum 4729-D: Emergency Protocol Update**

**From:** O5-7  
**To:** All Site Directors, Level 4+ Personnel  
**Subject:** SCPG-027 Containment Escalation  
**Classification:** EYES ONLY

Recent developments in SCPG-027 research have necessitated immediate protocol updates:

1. **Accelerated Timeline:** Mathematical analysis of infection patterns suggests SCPG-027 may reach critical threshold in significantly less time than originally estimated. New projections indicate possible Broken Masquerade scenario within 90-120 days.

2. **Adaptive Countermeasures:** SCPG-027 has demonstrated ability to rapidly adapt to Foundation containment efforts. Latest manifestations show evidence of active countermeasures against Foundation monitoring systems, including deployment of what appears to be anomalous computer viruses that target Pattern Recognition Algorithm Γ-7.

3. **Global Coordination:** Intelligence suggests SCPG-027 manifestations are becoming increasingly coordinated across multiple platforms and geographic regions. This implies either collective intelligence among infected individuals or direct control by the primary entity.

4. **Protocol LAST LIGHT Authorization:** I am hereby authorizing preparation of Protocol LAST LIGHT assets. All Site Directors are to begin discrete preparation for potential global internet infrastructure shutdown. Congressional liaisons are briefing select officials on potential "cyber warfare emergency" scenarios to provide cover for necessary actions.

5. **Research Priority Alpha:** All available Foundation resources are to be redirected toward SCPG-027 research. Projects of lesser priority are suspended indefinitely.

The stakes of this containment failure cannot be overstated. Based on current analysis, SCPG-027 represents a potential XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario through dimensional restructuring. Failure to contain this anomaly may result in the fundamental alteration of human consciousness and potentially reality itself.

All personnel are reminded that information regarding SCPG-027 is classified at the highest levels. Unauthorized disclosure will result in immediate termination and posthumous administration of amnestics to family members.

Stay vigilant. Humanity's future may depend on our success in the coming months.

**Final Note:** As of the date of this document's compilation, SCPG-027 has manifested 1,247 times across 89 different platforms. Foundation cyber-warfare assets have successfully contained 1,239 manifestations. Eight manifestations achieved viral status before containment, resulting in an estimated 890,000 total exposures.

Current global infection rate: 0.0923% of world population.

Days to critical threshold: 73.

The clock is ticking.
