# SCPG-009: The Weaver's Loom

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-009 is to be contained within a standard anomalous object containment chamber at Site-19. The chamber must be electromagnetically shielded and equipped with full-spectrum reality anchors. No organic material, particularly biological samples or living organisms, is to be brought within a 50-meter radius of SCPG-009's containment chamber without Level 4 authorization.

Access to SCPG-009 is restricted to personnel with Level 3/005 clearance. All personnel entering the containment chamber must wear standard hazardous materials suits modified with non-conductive outer layers. Any interaction with SCPG-009 must be conducted via robotic drone, and direct physical contact is strictly forbidden.

In the event of an unscheduled activation of SCPG-009, designated as an "Unraveling Event," local reality anchors are to be immediately brought to maximum power. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 ("Temporal Mechanics") is to be deployed to assess and mitigate any localized temporal or dimensional distortions.

**Description:** SCPG-009 is an ornate loom, approximately 2.5 meters in height and 1.5 meters in width. Its frame is constructed from an unknown, dark, wood-like material that is highly resistant to damage and analysis. The "threads" of the loom are composed of a shimmering, multicolored substance that emits low levels of Cherenkov radiation and appears to be in a constant state of flux, shifting in color and texture. Spectrographic analysis of these threads has been inconclusive, yielding readings that fluctuate wildly across known and unknown energy spectra.

SCPG-009's primary anomalous property manifests when organic material is brought within approximately 5 meters of it. The loom will spontaneously activate, and its threads will begin to move, seemingly "weaving" a pattern. This pattern corresponds to alterations in the past, present, or potential future of the organic material introduced.

Observed effects include:

- **Minor Alterations:** Changes in physical characteristics (e.g., hair color, minor scars appearing or disappearing).
- **Significant Alterations:** Changes in personal history, memories, or even species. In one test, a D-Class subject (D-9843) was exposed, and SCPG-009 activated. D-9843 was subsequently identified by Foundation records as a different individual with a completely different criminal history, though biometric data remained consistent.
- **Temporal Displacement:** On rare occasions, subjects have been observed to vanish entirely, presumably displaced in time or to an alternate dimension. Attempts to track these individuals have failed.
- **Paradoxical Outcomes:** SCPG-009 has demonstrated the ability to create causal paradoxes, though these are typically localized and self-correcting, often resulting in the "erasure" of the introduced organic material from all known timelines.

SCPG-009 does not appear to be sentient. Its activations are reflexive and directly tied to the proximity of organic matter. The complexity and scope of the alterations seem to correlate with the biological complexity of the introduced material. Inorganic materials do not trigger SCPG-009's anomalous properties.

**Addendum 005-1: Discovery**
SCPG-009 was recovered on ██/██/20██ from a remote, unmapped island in the [REDACTED] Ocean, following reports of anomalous temporal phenomena by a Foundation maritime patrol. The island's inhabitants, a previously uncontacted tribe, appeared to worship the loom, referring to it as the "Spinner of Fates." The tribe exhibited numerous minor genetic and historical anomalies consistent with prolonged exposure to SCPG-009. MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings") secured the object, and Class-B amnestics were administered to the recovery team due to observed minor temporal distortions in their personal histories post-mission.

**Addendum 005-2: Incident Log 005-Alpha**
On ██/██/20██, during routine maintenance of the containment chamber's sensor array, a technician accidentally dropped a standard toolkit within 4 meters of SCPG-009. The toolkit contained a leather strap. SCPG-009 activated. The leather strap was observed to rapidly age, decay, and then reform into a live, unidentified reptilian creature, which then de-materialized. The toolkit itself remained unaffected. This incident confirmed that even processed organic materials can trigger SCPG-009. Containment protocols were updated to restrict all organic materials, regardless of state.

**Addendum 005-3: Researcher Note - Dr. Aris Thorne**
The patterns SCPG-009 weaves are not random. We've been attempting to decode them, correlating the visual "tapestry" with the observed alterations. There's a logic, albeit an alien one. It's as if it's not just changing things, but re-writing them according to some unknown blueprint. The implications are... unsettling. If this loom can rewrite the past of a single cell, what could it do if it interfaced with something on a larger scale? The "threads" themselves defy our understanding of matter and energy. We are observing something that operates on principles far beyond our current scientific paradigms. Further research into the loom's material composition and the nature of its "threads" is paramount, despite the inherent risks.
