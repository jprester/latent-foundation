# SCPG-020: The Welcomer

**Object Class:** Euclid

## Special Containment Procedures

Lake Avernus (Site-6712) is enclosed within a 5-meter-high electrified perimeter fence under cover story "Ecological Research Reserve - Government Property: No Trespassing." Armed perimeter patrols (min. 4 personnel) required 24/7. Unauthorized intruders to be detained, administered Class-B amnestics, and released 100km away.

Underwater hydrophones and motion sensors must continuously monitor the lake. Anomalous sonar signatures >15m length or emitting <20Hz frequencies require immediate reporting. Sonar buoys to emit randomized deterrent frequencies (Protocol Theta-7 "Static Lullaby") every 6 hours.

## Description

SCPG-020 is a colossal amorphous entity inhabiting Lake Avernus, Oregon. Visual confirmation limited by depth, turbidity, and anomalous light-absorption field. Sonar indicates gelatinous mass (80-120m diameter) of shifting bioluminescent tissue capable of forming pseudopods or mimicking topography.

Primary anomalous effect (Event 6712-Alpha): Direct visual observation induces overwhelming compulsion to enter water and approach SCPG-020. Subjects report sensations of "belonging," "peace," and auditory hallucinations of harmonic humming. Upon contact, subjects are enveloped and assimilated within 2-7 minutes with no recoverable remains. SCPG-020 exhibits intensified bioluminescence for 12-48 hours post-assimilation.

## Discovery

Foundation attention followed disappearance of 17 Oakhaven residents over 18 months. Local folklore referenced "The Welcomer" in lake. MTF Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") confirmed entity during lunar breach event. Agent ██████ compromised during observation, leading to containment.

## Addendum 6712-2: Incident Delta

During Protocol Theta-7 failure (██/██/████), SCPG-020 breached surface, emitting focused bioluminescent beam toward Oakhaven. 197 civilians (63% population) experienced Event 6712-Alpha, breaching perimeter despite countermeasures. 184 assimilated. Cover story: Industrial chemical spill. Perimeter upgraded to Level-4.

> **Researcher Note (Dr. Elena Voss):**  
> SCPG-020 doesn't hunt - it _calls_. Offers an end to loneliness so profound it bypasses reason. After Incident Delta: Was it calling us? Or finally answering _them_?
