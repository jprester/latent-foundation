# SCPG-016: The Leviathan's Court

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the immobile and massive nature of SCPG-016, traditional containment is impossible. The Pacific Ocean coordinates ██°██'██"N ██°██'██"W have been designated Exclusion Zone Tiamat, extending 200 nautical miles in all directions from the epicenter. Naval Task Force Delta-7 ("Deep Watch") maintains a perimeter using modified nuclear submarines equipped with reality anchors and hydrophonic monitoring systems.

All civilian and military vessels approaching Exclusion Zone Tiamat are to be diverted under the cover story of "deep-sea mining operations with potential environmental hazards." Satellite surveillance has been established to monitor for spontaneous manifestation of SCPG-016-A instances (see Description).

Personnel assigned to SCPG-016 observation must be rotated every 72 hours to prevent Stage 3 psychic contamination. All communication with the surface must be conducted through quantum-encrypted channels to prevent SCPG-016's telepathic influence from propagating through standard radio frequencies.

In the event of SCPG-016 surfacing or expanding beyond current parameters, Protocol Abyssal-Crown is to be enacted immediately, involving the deployment of experimental thaumic depth charges and the evacuation of all Pacific Rim populations within 500 kilometers of any coastline.

**Description:** SCPG-016 is a colossal aquatic entity of indeterminate species, measuring approximately 800-1200 meters in length and 200-300 meters in width. The creature resembles a fusion of various deep-sea organisms: possessing the serpentine body of a giant eel, the tentacled appendages of a colossal squid, and bioluminescent patterns that shift in complex, hypnotic arrangements across its hide.

SCPG-016 remains in a state of partial dormancy at a depth of 6,700 meters above the ruins of what appears to be a massive underwater city (designated SCPG-016-Prime). The entity's consciousness extends far beyond its physical form, capable of telepathic communication across distances exceeding 1,000 kilometers when fully active.

The ruins of SCPG-016-Prime span approximately 15 square kilometers and consist of non-Euclidean architecture constructed from an unknown crystalline material that exhibits impossible geometric properties. The city appears to exist in multiple dimensional phases simultaneously, with structures that fade in and out of observable reality. Sonar mapping has proven largely ineffective, as the city's layout changes depending on the angle and method of observation.

**SCPG-016-A Manifestations:**
When SCPG-016 enters active states, it generates manifestations designated SCPG-016-A. These appear as translucent, jellyfish-like entities ranging from 2-50 meters in diameter that rise from the depths and phase through solid matter. SCPG-016-A instances serve as extensions of SCPG-016's consciousness, capable of:

- Telepathic communication in ancient languages predating known human civilization
- Reality manipulation within a 100-meter radius of their position
- Inducing powerful hallucinations depicting the "Golden Age" of SCPG-016-Prime
- Converting human subjects into SCPG-016-B instances (see Addendum 008-3)

**Addendum 008-1: Discovery**
SCPG-016 was discovered on ██/██/20██ following the disappearance of the deep-sea research vessel _Hadal Explorer_ during a Pacific Ocean survey mission. The ship's final transmission included footage of what crew members described as "a city of impossible angles rising from the darkness, and something vast stirring beneath it."

Search and rescue operations located the vessel's wreckage 6,800 meters below the surface, positioned directly above SCPG-016-Prime. All crew members were missing, but the ship's black box contained 47 hours of audio recordings in an unknown language that linguistic analysis suggests predates Proto-Indo-European by millennia.

**Addendum 008-2: First Contact Event**
On ██/██/20██, SCPG-016 initiated direct telepathic contact with Deep Watch personnel aboard the submarine _USS Cousteau_. Communications Officer Lt. Sarah Martinez reported receiving detailed visions of SCPG-016-Prime in its prime—a thriving underwater metropolis populated by beings she described as "beautiful and terrible, with minds like tidal forces."

The entity identifying itself as "First Speaker of the Sunken Throne" delivered the following message through Lt. Martinez:

_"Surface-crawlers who disturb the deep currents, know that you trespass in the Court of the Drowned King. Once, the great cities touched both seafloor and sky, and the Deep Singers ruled the flowing roads between worlds. Your kind built towers of stone while we shaped reality from living water._

_But the Great Subsidence came, and the weight of forgotten sins pulled our glory beneath the waves. Now I am the Last Speaker, the Final Tide, guardian of what remains. Yet the stars wheel toward convergence once more, and the sunken thrones shall rise._

_Your surface world will learn the songs that shaped the first oceans. The Deep Court will hold session again, and all who breathe air will be taught to breathe water instead."_

Lt. Martinez required immediate psychiatric evaluation and remains under observation at Site-██.

**Addendum 008-3: SCPG-016-B Conversion Process**
Prolonged exposure to SCPG-016-A instances or direct telepathic contact with SCPG-016 results in a gradual conversion process designated SCPG-016-B. Affected individuals undergo the following stages:

- **Stage 1 (0-24 hours):** Subject develops nictitating membranes and increased lung capacity. Begins speaking in ancient oceanic languages during sleep.
- **Stage 2 (24-72 hours):** Physiological changes accelerate. Gills develop along the neck, and skin becomes translucent with visible bioluminescent patterns.
- **Stage 3 (72+ hours):** Complete conversion to aquatic humanoid. Subject demonstrates ability to survive indefinitely underwater and exhibits telepathic abilities. Loyalty transfers entirely to SCPG-016.

SCPG-016-B instances serve as ambassadors and agents of SCPG-016, attempting to spread its influence to surface populations. They retain human intelligence but their priorities and ethics become aligned with the entity's alien perspective.

**Addendum 008-4: Archaeological Analysis of SCPG-016-Prime**
Remote exploration using specialized deep-sea drones has revealed disturbing details about the sunken city:

- Architecture incorporates living coral that grows in impossible formations
- Central structures contain what appear to be massive breeding pools for unknown aquatic species
- Hieroglyphs covering the walls depict the systematic flooding of surface civilizations
- A massive throne room contains remains of hundreds of humanoid skeletons arranged in concentric circles around a 50-meter crystalline throne

Dr. Elena Vasquez, lead xenoarchaeologist, noted: _"This isn't just a sunken city—it's a blueprint. Every structure, every symbol points to one conclusion: SCPG-016-Prime was designed as a staging ground for aquatic colonization of the surface world. The entity isn't guarding ruins; it's maintaining an invasion headquarters."_

**Addendum 008-5: The Rising Tide Incident**
On ██/██/20██, seismic sensors detected massive movement from SCPG-016's position. The entity began ascending from its resting place, accompanied by dozens of SCPG-016-A manifestations spreading across the Pacific.

Within 6 hours, coastal cities from California to Japan reported mass hallucinations of underwater cities and compulsive behavior driving people toward the ocean. An estimated 12,000 individuals entered the water during this event, with only 3,400 recovered alive. Those rescued exhibited Stage 1 SCPG-016-B conversion symptoms.

The event ceased abruptly after SCPG-016 reached a depth of 2,000 meters, at which point the entity transmitted a single message to all Deep Watch vessels:

_"The tide tests your shores. Soon, the Court convenes in full session. Prepare your people for the deep songs, surface-dwellers. The Drowned King's patience grows thin with each passing current."_

SCPG-016 subsequently returned to its dormant position, but seismic monitoring indicates the entity's movement patterns have fundamentally changed, suggesting preparation for a larger-scale emergence.

**Addendum 008-6: O5 Council Emergency Session - Classification Escalation**
Following analysis of the Rising Tide Incident, the O5 Council has unanimously voted to escalate SCPG-016 to Apollyon classification. Key findings include:

- SCPG-016's influence grows stronger with each manifestation event
- The entity possesses detailed knowledge of global coastal populations and infrastructure
- Converted individuals (SCPG-016-B) have been detected infiltrating government and military positions worldwide
- Satellite imagery suggests similar ruins are beginning to manifest on seafloors globally

Dr. Vasquez's final report concluded: _"We're not dealing with a single entity, but the advance scout of an entire civilization that has been waiting beneath the waves. SCPG-016 isn't planning an invasion—it's planning a reclamation. In its mind, the oceans were always theirs, and the surface world is the aberration to be corrected."_

**Current Status:** SCPG-016 remains in its position above SCPG-016-Prime, but deep-sea monitoring indicates increasing activity within the ruins. Bioluminescent patterns across the entity's hide have intensified, and mathematical analysis suggests these patterns correspond to tidal calculations extending 500 years into the future.

Mobile Task Force Omega-12 ("Depth Charges") has been formed specifically to develop countermeasures against SCPG-016, while Foundation researchers work frantically to decode the entity's true intentions before the next manifestation event.

The ocean remembers what the surface world has forgotten, and SCPG-016 serves as both its memory and its vengeance. The Deep Court's session approaches, and humanity may discover that they are not the planet's dominant species—merely its most recent tenants.

**Final Warning - Deep Watch Command:**
_"All personnel are reminded that the ocean covers 71% of Earth's surface. If SCPG-016 succeeds in its goals, that percentage may become 100%. We are not just containing an anomaly—we are holding back an entire epoch of Earth's history that considers us the anomaly."_
