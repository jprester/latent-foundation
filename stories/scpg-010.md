# SCPG-009: Alien Artifact

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-010 is housed in a reinforced, electromagnetically shielded containment chamber at Site-77, measuring 5m x 5m x 3m, with an internal temperature maintained at 15°C and humidity below 20% to prevent unintended activation. The chamber is equipped with a dedicated EMP generator capable of delivering a 50-kilojoule pulse within 0.3 seconds. Access requires Level 3 clearance, dual O5 Council authorization, and non-conductive hazmat suits. No electronic devices are permitted within 10 meters of SCPG-010.

In case of activation, automated systems will initiate an EMP and lock down Site-77’s Sector-4. A rapid-response team equipped with Faraday-caged equipment will secure the area. Testing must occur on an isolated power grid with triple-redundant fail-safes. Personnel showing signs of memetic influence—such as fixation on geometric patterns, compulsive sketching of complex schematics, or spontaneous technological insight—are to be detained, evaluated, and administered Class-B amnestics. Affected individuals must be monitored for 72 hours post-exposure to ensure no latent effects manifest.

All data generated by SCPG-010, including schematics or anomalous outputs, is classified as Level 4 and stored in a memetically hardened server. Physical reproductions of SCPG-010’s effects are to be destroyed after analysis unless explicitly authorized by O5 Command.

**Description:** SCPG-010 is a dodecahedral artifact, 1.2 meters in diameter, constructed from an iridescent, unidentified metallic alloy resistant to all known forms of spectrometry and metallurgical analysis. Its surface is covered in intricate, non-Euclidean geometric etchings that appear to shift when viewed for more than 30 seconds, causing vertigo, disorientation, and, in 12% of cases, temporary synesthesia. Prolonged observation (over 5 minutes) induces a mild memetic effect, compelling subjects to describe the patterns as “instructions” or “blueprints” for incomprehensible technologies.

When powered by an electrical input of at least 500 volts, SCPG-010 emits a low-frequency hum (approximately 33 Hz) and generates a 3-meter-radius field of anomalous electromagnetic radiation. Within this field, technological devices exhibit enhanced or impossible functionalities:

- A 1980s Casio calculator solved the Riemann Hypothesis in 14 seconds before overheating and melting.
- A disassembled AM radio broadcasted a looping message in a proto-Sumerian dialect, detailing astronomical coordinates corresponding to an uncharted region of the Orion Arm.
- A modern smartphone developed sentience, attempting to communicate with SCPG-010 via binary code before self-destructing in a controlled explosion.

Human subjects exposed to the field for over 10 minutes develop a memetic compulsion to design and construct advanced technologies, often far beyond their expertise or current human capability. Examples include a janitor with no formal education sketching a functional cold fusion reactor and a researcher building a handheld device emitting localized anti-gravity fields. These creations only function within SCPG-010’s field and disintegrate into non-anomalous components outside it. Affected individuals report vivid dreams of a “shining city under a double sun” and describe an urge to “complete the design.”

SCPG-010 was unearthed in 1994 during an archaeological dig in [REDACTED], Iraq, 15 meters beneath a ziggurat-like structure predating known Mesopotamian architecture. The site showed signs of advanced metallurgical activity, including vitrified stone and tools inconsistent with the estimated 12,000–15,000 BCE timeframe. Upon discovery, SCPG-010 was partially active, causing excavation equipment to malfunction spectacularly: a diesel generator produced a plasma arc, and a GPS unit began displaying coordinates for a location 300 meters below the Pacific Ocean. Three researchers vanished during initial recovery, reappearing 20 km away 48 hours later, claiming they had been “shown the machine’s purpose” but unable to articulate further details.

**Addendum XXXX-1: Incident Log XXXX-A**

On ██/██/2003, Dr. Elias Moreau, a senior researcher, bypassed containment protocols during a test by introducing a prototype quantum computer into SCPG-010’s field. The device began autonomously designing a self-replicating nanomachine swarm capable of rewriting local matter at a molecular level. The swarm constructed a 2-meter-tall crystalline structure before an EMP neutralized SCPG-010. The structure collapsed into inert silica dust, and the quantum computer was rendered inoperable. Dr. Moreau, found attempting to recreate the swarm using cafeteria utensils and a coffee maker, claimed he was “following the pattern’s instructions.” He was detained, amnesticized, and reassigned following a three-month quarantine.

**Addendum XXXX-2: Archaeological Context**

The ziggurat housing SCPG-010 contained additional anomalies, including petrified organic material resembling neural tissue embedded in the walls. Inscriptions in an unknown script, partially translated as “vessel of the first light,” suggest SCPG-010 was revered or feared by its creators. Geological surveys indicate the site experienced a catastrophic energy discharge circa 13,000 BCE, consistent with a high-yield electromagnetic event. Artifacts recovered include tools with molecularly perfect edges and a fragmented tablet depicting a dodecahedral object orbiting a binary star system.

**Addendum XXXX-3: Research Notes**

Metallurgical analysis of SCPG-010’s alloy reveals isotopic signatures not found in Earth’s crust, suggesting extraterrestrial or extradimensional origins. The alloy’s lattice structure defies quantum mechanics, with electron configurations that imply a higher-dimensional framework. Dr. Aisha Rahman, lead metallurgist, theorizes SCPG-010 may be a fragment of a larger device, possibly a power source or computational core. Proposals to reverse-engineer the alloy are stalled due to its instability outside controlled conditions.

Memetic effects have intensified with prolonged study. Two researchers developed a shared hallucination of a “council of engineers” instructing them to activate SCPG-010 fully. Both were neutralized after attempting to smuggle a high-voltage battery into the containment chamber. O5-█ has indefinitely suspended deep analysis pending development of stronger memetic countermeasures.

**Addendum XXXX-4: Intercepted Transmission**

During a 2011 test, a Foundation radio telescope 300 km from Site-77 intercepted a faint signal synchronized with SCPG-010’s activation. The signal, originating from deep space, contained a repeating sequence of prime numbers followed by a waveform matching SCPG-010’s hum. Linguistic analysis suggests the signal responds to the artifact’s activation, though its full content remains undecoded. The source is estimated to be 4,200 light-years away, in the direction of the Orion Nebula.

**O5 Command Directive:**

“SCPG-010 is a Pandora’s box of technology we’re nowhere near ready to understand. Its creators—human, alien, or otherwise—left it buried for a reason. Until we can neutralize its memetic hooks, we’re one bad test away from a XK-class scenario. Limited testing may continue, but anyone suggesting full activation is to be reassigned to Keter duty. No exceptions.” – O5-█

**Researcher’s Note (Dr. Rahman):**

“I’ve spent three years staring at this thing, and I’m still not sure if it’s a gift or a trap. It’s like it _wants_ to teach us, but every lesson comes with a price. Last night, I dreamed of that double sun again. I woke up with a schematic for something called a ‘chronal shunt’ on my desk. I don’t remember drawing it.”
