# SCPG-010: Runestone

**Object Class**: Keter

**Special Containment Procedures** SCPG-010 is contained in a reinforced subterranean chamber at Site-19, located in a remote region of northern Norway. The chamber is constructed with a composite of runestone-infused titanium alloy and obsidian, etched with counter-runic wards derived from ancient Scandinavian texts to suppress SCP-YYYY’s anomalous effects. The chamber is kept at a constant temperature of -30°C to limit the entity’s activity, and all lighting is restricted to ultraviolet wavelengths to disrupt its manifestation.

Direct interaction with SCPG-010 is forbidden. Only personnel with Level 4 clearance and training in anti-thaumaturgic countermeasures (ATC-2 certification or higher) may access the containment area, and only through remote-operated drones equipped with runic shielding. All personnel must wear Foundation-issued amulets inscribed with protective Elder Futhark runes (specifically Ansuz and Algiz) during operations within a 5-km radius of the containment site. Any personnel displaying signs of thaumaturgic corruption—such as speaking in Old Norse, exhibiting frostbite without exposure, or chanting runes—must be immediately isolated and subjected to Class-Theta amnestics.

In the event of a containment breach, Site-19 will initiate Protocol Yggdrasil-Lock, deploying MTF Lambda-12 (“Rune Wardens”) to recontain SCPG-010 using a combination of runic binding rituals and high-yield incendiary devices. A 20-km exclusion zone will be established, with civilian evacuation under the cover story of a volcanic eruption. All documentation of SCPG-010 must be written in a Foundation-approved runic cipher and stored in a thaumaturgically sealed vault to prevent unauthorized access or corruption.

**Description:** SCP-YYYY, tentatively designated “Draugvind,” is a thaumaturgic entity manifesting as a spectral, humanoid figure wreathed in an ethereal blizzard of ice and shadow. Its form is semi-corporeal, composed of frozen mist and faintly glowing runes that shift between Elder Futhark and unknown symbols. The entity’s presence induces a localized drop in temperature to -50°C within a 100-meter radius and generates auditory hallucinations of howling winds and Old Norse chants.

SCP-YYYY’s primary anomalous effect is the propagation of a thaumaturgic corruption, designated SCP-YYYY-A, which spreads through exposure to its runes or voice. Affected individuals (SCP-YYYY-1) exhibit an immediate compulsion to carve runes into their skin or nearby surfaces, chanting in Old Norse as their body temperature drops rapidly. Within 12 hours, SCP-YYYY-1 instances undergo a transformation into draugr-like entities, displaying enhanced strength, immunity to cold, and a violent compulsion to serve SCP-YYYY. The corruption can spread through physical contact with SCP-YYYY-1 instances or exposure to the runes they carve, with a 95% infection rate in unshielded populations.

SCPG-010 demonstrates sapience and a connection to Scandinavian pagan mythology, frequently invoking names such as “Ymir” and “Fenrir” during manifestations. It appears capable of manipulating ice, wind, and shadow to create localized blizzards or summon spectral wolves (designated SCP-YYYY-2) that dissolve into mist upon termination. The entity has shown hostility toward Foundation personnel, targeting those with knowledge of Norse mythology or runic systems, suggesting a selective predatory behavior.

**Addendum YYYY-1:** Discovery

SCPG-010 was first encountered on [DATE REDACTED] in the Jotunheimen National Park, Norway, following reports of a “living storm” that wiped out a remote village of 150 residents. Survivors described a towering figure of ice and shadow, chanting in an unknown tongue as it summoned wolves made of frost. Mobile Task Force Lambda-12 was deployed, suffering 40% casualties due to SCP-YYYY-A infections before the entity was contained using a hastily constructed runic circle. The area was evacuated under the cover story of a freak snowstorm, and residual thaumaturgic effects were neutralized through the application of counter-runes.

**Addendum YYYY-2:** Incident Log YYYY-Alpha

On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-010 breached containment during a routine runic recalibration, exploiting a flaw in the ward system. The entity manifested outside its chamber, reducing Site-19’s ambient temperature to -60°C and summoning 12 instances of SCP-YYYY-2. The breach resulted in the infection of 30% of on-site personnel, who began carving runes into the facility’s walls, accelerating SCP-YYYY’s influence. The breach was contained after 5 hours through the intervention of MTF Lambda-12, who performed a binding ritual using a reconstructed artifact (designated the “Gjallarhorn Fragment”). Infected personnel were terminated via Protocol Frost-Purge-9, and the containment chamber was reinforced with additional wards.

s**Addendum YYYY-3:s** Expanded Incident Log YYYY-Beta

On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-010 initiated a second breach without physical manifestation, instead projecting its influence through a series of carved runes that appeared spontaneously on Site-19’s outer walls. The runes emitted a thaumaturgic signal that induced SCP-YYYY-A infections in nearby civilian populations, affecting 3,000 individuals across northern Norway. Infected individuals began migrating toward Site-19, chanting in unison and carving runes that amplified SCP-YYYY’s influence.

MTF Lambda-12, supported by local Foundation assets, contained the outbreak by deploying a thaumaturgic counter-signal derived from the Gjallarhorn Fragment, neutralizing the runes’ effects. Infected civilians were treated with Class-Theta amnestics, and the incident was covered up as a mass hallucination caused by auroral activity. The event prompted the Foundation to increase the exclusion zone around Site-19 to 50 km and implement stricter runic security protocols.

**Addendum YYYY-4:** Entity Behavior and Mythological Connections

Analysis of SCP-YYYY’s chants and runes suggests a direct connection to Scandinavian pagan mythology, specifically the primordial giant Ymir and the apocalyptic wolf Fenrir. The entity frequently references “the breaking of the world” and “the frost that binds,” aligning with myths of Ragnarök. Dr. Astrid Lindholm, Site-19’s lead thaumaturgist, theorizes that SCPG-010 may be a remnant of a pre-Christian ritual gone awry, possibly an attempt to summon or bind a mythological entity that instead became unbound and corrupted.

SCPG-010 has shown increasing aggression toward containment efforts, adapting its thaumaturgic output to counter Foundation runes. During a controlled test, a D-Class subject wearing a runic amulet survived exposure for 22 seconds, reporting that SCPG-010 “sang of a frozen end, where the wolf eats the sun.” The entity’s ability to summon SCP-YYYY-2 instances has escalated, with recent manifestations producing up to 20 spectral wolves at once, each capable of independent action.

**Addendum YYYY-5:** The Final Containment Breach

On [DATE REDACTED], SCPG-010 initiated a catastrophic breach during a lunar eclipse, a period associated with heightened thaumaturgic activity in Norse tradition. The entity shattered its containment chamber, disabling all runic wards and plunging Site-19 into a -70°C blizzard. SCPG-010 manifested as a 15-meter-tall figure of ice and shadow, surrounded by a pack of 50 SCP-YYYY-2 instances. The entity’s chants reverberated across a 100-km radius, infecting 80% of Site-19 personnel and spreading SCP-YYYY-A to nearby population centers.

The O5 Council authorized Protocol Ragnarök-Null, deploying an experimental thaumaturgic weapon codenamed “Mjölnir Echo,” a device designed to channel raw energy into a runic blast capable of disrupting SCP-YYYY’s form. MTF Lambda-12 activated the weapon at the cost of their lives, as the blast’s feedback loop caused a thaumaturgic backlash that killed all personnel within a 10-km radius. The weapon successfully dissipated SCP-YYYY’s physical form, reducing it to a dormant runestone (designated SCP-YYYY-Omega) now stored in a sealed vault at Site-00.

However, residual thaumaturgic effects persist. The runestone emits faint whispers of Old Norse, and personnel stationed near Site-00 report dreams of a frozen wolf devouring the sky. Dr. Lindholm’s final report, written before her death during the breach, warned: “We didn’t kill it. We only delayed it. The frost is coming, and it remembers us.”

**Conclusion:** A Compelling End

The Foundation’s encounter with SCPG-010 has exposed the limits of its ability to contain entities tied to ancient mythologies. The entity’s connection to Ragnarök suggests it may be a harbinger of a larger, unavoidable event—one the Foundation is ill-equipped to prevent. SCP-YYYY-Omega remains under constant surveillance, but its whispers grow louder during lunar eclipses, hinting at a potential reawakening. The O5 Council has classified the runestone as a potential XK-class threat, and debates continue over whether to destroy it, risking an unknown reaction, or preserve it in hopes of finding a permanent solution. For now, the frost waits, a silent promise of an end yet to come, as the echoes of a forgotten age linger in the shadows of Site-00.
