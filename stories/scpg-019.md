# SCPG-019: The Ossuary Conclave

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the distributed and historically persistent nature of SCPG-019, traditional containment is not feasible. Foundation assets embedded within archaeological, theological, and historical research institutions maintain surveillance for SCPG-019-related activities. Any discoveries of pre-Christian ossuaries, bone churches, or similar structures in regions with documented SCPG-019 activity are to be immediately secured and examined by Mobile Task Force Lambda-8 ("Grave Robbers").

All suspected members of the Ossuary Conclave (designated POI-019-Alpha through POI-019-Omega) are to be monitored via electronic surveillance, financial tracking, and periodic wellness checks. Any gathering of three or more suspected Conclave members triggers automatic deployment of MTF Lambda-8 for interdiction.

Foundation historians maintain active investigation into the "Vanishing of Carcassonne" (1348 CE), the "Prague Seminary Incident" (1592 CE), and the "Whitmore Academy Disappearances" (1889 CE) as potential historical manifestations of SCPG-019 activity. Archaeological sites associated with these events remain under Foundation oversight.

**Description:** SCPG-019 refers to a recurring anomalous phenomenon involving the systematic disappearance of human groups following the performance of specific ritual activities. These rituals are conducted by members of an ancient secret society known as the "Ossuary Conclave" or "Custodes Ossium" (Keepers of Bones), whose documented history spans at least 1,700 years.

The Ossuary Conclave appears to worship an entity or entities referred to in recovered texts as "The Hollow Sovereign," "She-Who-Dwells-in-Marrow," and "The First Hunger." The society's primary ritual, designated SCPG-019-A (the "Communion of Hollow Saints"), requires the following components:

- Exactly forty-nine (49) human participants
- An ossuary, bone church, or similar structure containing human remains
- Specific astronomical alignments occurring during solar eclipses
- A ritual implement known as the "Thrice-Blessed Chalice of Sorrows"
- Recitation of the "Litany of the Devoured" in pre-Medieval Latin

When SCPG-019-A is successfully performed, all participants vanish completely from baseline reality within a 6-hour window following the ritual's completion. No trace of the participants has ever been recovered, including DNA evidence, fingerprints, or personal effects. Witnesses report that participants appear to "fade away" gradually, becoming translucent before disappearing entirely.

**Historical Manifestations:**

**The Vanishing of Carcassonne (1348 CE):** During the Black Death, an entire monastery of 49 Franciscan monks disappeared overnight from their abbey built atop pre-Christian burial grounds. Local records describe strange chanting heard from the monastery's catacombs during a solar eclipse. No bodies were ever found, though the monks' robes were discovered arranged in a perfect circle around an ancient stone altar carved with symbols that do not match any known Christian iconography.

**The Prague Seminary Incident (1592 CE):** A group of 49 theological students and their professors vanished from St. Vitus Seminary during a research expedition to study "heretical texts recovered from Bohemian burial sites." The only witness, a seminary cook, reported seeing the group enter the institution's basement ossuary at sunset and never emerge. Search parties found the ossuary empty except for a chalice made from human skull fragments, filled with a dark liquid that analysis later identified as a mixture of human blood from 49 different individuals.

**The Whitmore Academy Disappearances (1889 CE):** Forty-nine members of the Whitmore Archaeological Society vanished during an expedition to investigate "Celtic burial practices" in rural Scotland. Their camp was found intact, with 49 beds arranged in concentric circles around a pit containing hundreds of human bones arranged in complex geometric patterns. Local authorities noted the disappearance coincided with a total solar eclipse visible from the site.

**Addendum 019-1: The Modern Conclave**

Foundation surveillance identified the current iteration of the Ossuary Conclave in 1987, following analysis of financial transactions, academic research patterns, and travel records that matched historical SCPG-019 activity signatures. The modern Conclave appears to consist of academics, archaeologists, historians, and wealthy collectors with interests in pre-Christian burial practices and "death cults."

Key figures include:

- **Dr. Helena Marchetti** (POI-019-Alpha): Vatican archaeologist specializing in early Christian ossuary art
- **Professor James Blackwood** (POI-019-Beta): Oxford medievalist, expert in pre-Christian European burial practices
- **Viktor Kronos** (POI-019-Gamma): Private collector of ancient ritual implements, suspected owner of the current "Thrice-Blessed Chalice"
- **Dr. Sarah Chen** (POI-019-Delta): Anthropologist studying "liminal spaces between life and death" in various cultures

Intelligence suggests the Conclave has been preparing for a major ritual coinciding with the solar eclipse of [REDACTED], 2024.

**Addendum 019-2: Intercepted Communications**

On ██/██/20██, Foundation signals intelligence intercepted an encrypted communication between POI-019-Alpha and POI-019-Beta:

**MARCHETTI:** "The Prague fragments have been translated. The Sovereign's requirements are more specific than we understood."

**BLACKWOOD:** "The vessel must be consecrated with the tears of the willing, not the blood of the unwilling. Previous attempts failed because they forced participation."

**MARCHETTI:** "And the destination? The texts speak of the 'Marrow Kingdom' as if it were a place, not a state of being."

**BLACKWOOD:** "Perhaps both. The disappeared don't die, Helena. They become. The Hollow Sovereign doesn't consume—she transforms."

**MARCHETTI:** "The eclipse window approaches. Are we prepared to join them?"

**BLACKWOOD:** "Forty-seven others have already agreed. We need only choose the final two."

This communication prompted immediate escalation to O5 Council oversight and deployment of MTF Lambda-8.

**Addendum 019-3: The Anatomy Institute Incident**

On ██/██/20██, MTF Lambda-8 intercepted a gathering of suspected Conclave members at the abandoned Mercy General Anatomy Institute in [REDACTED], Pennsylvania. The building, constructed in 1923 over a Colonial-era cemetery, contained an intact bone room used for medical education until 1978.

Forty-seven individuals were found arranged in concentric circles around a central altar constructed from human femurs and skulls. All participants appeared to be in a trance state, chanting in unison in an archaic Latin dialect. At the center of the formation stood Dr. Marchetti, holding an ornate chalice carved from what appeared to be a human skull.

As MTF Lambda-8 breached the building, Dr. Marchetti shouted: "The Sovereign calls, and we answer! The marrow kingdom awaits the faithful!" She then consumed the chalice's contents—later determined to be a mixture of ground human bone, wine, and an unknown organic compound with psychoactive properties.

Within minutes of consumption, all forty-seven participants began exhibiting the same "fading" effect reported in historical accounts. Their physical forms became increasingly translucent as they continued chanting. MTF Lambda-8 attempted physical intervention but their hands passed through the participants as if they were becoming incorporeal.

Dr. Marchetti's final words, captured on tactical recording equipment, were: "Tell them we go willingly to serve the First Hunger. The bones remember what flesh forgets. We will prepare the way for the Sovereign's return."

All forty-seven individuals vanished completely by 03:47 AM. No trace remained except for scorch marks on the floor in the precise shape of the ritual circle and the chalice, which had been transformed into ordinary limestone.

**Addendum 019-4: Post-Incident Analysis - Dr. Aris Thorne**

The successful completion of SCPG-019-A at the Anatomy Institute represents the first fully documented instance of the ritual in modern times. Analysis of tactical recordings reveals several disturbing implications:

1. The participants did not appear to be under external mental influence—all showed signs of genuine religious fervor and willing participation.

2. The "fading" process appears to be a form of dimensional translocation rather than disintegration or death.

3. Electromagnetic readings during the event suggest the opening of a temporary dimensional rift to an unknown location.

4. The Conclave's reference to "preparing the way" implies this was not an endpoint but a preliminary action in a larger plan.

Most concerning is the discovery of similar ritual sites across seventeen countries, all showing signs of recent preparation. Carbon dating of bone arrangements suggests coordinated activity leading up to the Anatomy Institute incident.

**Addendum 019-5: The Sovereign's Message**

Three days after the Anatomy Institute incident, Foundation seismographs detected unusual vibrations emanating from ossuary sites worldwide. Analysis revealed these vibrations formed a complex pattern that, when decoded, produced the following message in pre-Medieval Latin:

_"The Willing Vessels have opened the first door. The Marrow Kingdom stirs with ancient hunger. Forty-nine times forty-nine shall answer the call, until the boundaries between bone and flesh, death and life, dissolve. The Hollow Sovereign rises, and the age of meat ends."_

Mathematical analysis suggests this refers to a total of 2,401 individuals across forty-nine separate ritual events—meaning the Anatomy Institute incident was merely the first of a planned series.

**Current Threat Assessment:**

SCPG-019 represents a potential XK-Class End-of-World scenario through progressive dimensional destabilization. Each successful ritual appears to weaken the barriers between baseline reality and the "Marrow Kingdom," potentially allowing the Hollow Sovereign direct access to our dimension.

Foundation resources are now focused on identifying and preventing the remaining forty-eight planned rituals while researching countermeasures against what may be humanity's first encounter with a genuinely alien form of worship—one that views death not as an ending, but as a doorway to service of something far older and hungrier than any human deity.

**Final Note - O5-██:**

The Ossuary Conclave represents everything we fear most about Groups of Interest: they are intelligent, organized, patient, and completely committed to goals that exist beyond human comprehension. They do not seek power in any conventional sense—they seek transcendence through obliteration of the self in service to something that may predate human civilization entirely.

We have contained many threats to humanity's existence, but never one that humanity itself actively participates in with such devotion. The disappeared do not resist—they celebrate. They do not fear the Hollow Sovereign—they worship it.

And somewhere in the spaces between dimensions, forty-seven souls who were once human now serve as heralds for something that views our reality as nothing more than a temporary obstruction to its endless, ancient hunger.

_The bones remember. And they are calling others to remember with them._
