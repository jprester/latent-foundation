# SCPG-025: Dark notes

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is contained within a sealed, anechoic chamber at Site-17. The chamber is continuously monitored by audio and visual recording equipment. No personnel are permitted within the containment chamber without approval from at least two (2) Level 4 researchers.

Any individuals exposed to SCP-XXXX's auditory effects must be immediately transferred to a secure medical facility for observation and treatment. Exposure to SCP-XXXX's effects is considered a Biological Hazard Level 4 event, requiring full decontamination and quarantine protocols.

Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-XXXX's activation and effects, no attempts to study or interact with the object directly are currently authorized. Research is limited to analysis of recorded data until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a music box of unknown origin, measuring approximately 20 cm x 15 cm x 10 cm. It appears to be constructed from mahogany wood with intricate hand-carved designs along the exterior. The top of the music box features a rotating cylindrical drum with protruding metal tines. When the crank handle is turned, the drum rotates, causing the tines to pluck a metallic comb and produce musical notes.

The anomalous properties of SCP-XXXX manifest when the music box is played. At random intervals during operation, the musical notes produced will abruptly shift in pitch, volume, and timbre. These auditory distortions are often described as unsettling or discordant by those who hear them.

More concerning are the biological effects experienced by individuals exposed to SCP-XXXX's auditory anomalies. Reported symptoms include:

- Severe headaches and migraines
- Auditory hallucinations
- Temporary deafness or tinnitus
- Disorientation and vertigo
- Nausea and vomiting
- In extreme cases, unconsciousness or cardiac arrest

The range and intensity of these effects seem to vary based on unknown factors. Some subjects have reported only mild discomfort, while others have experienced life-threatening symptoms from the same audio distortion. The Foundation has been unable to establish any clear pattern or predictor for SCP-XXXX's effects.

It is currently unknown if SCP-XXXX's anomalous properties are an intentional function of its design or an unintended side effect. Likewise, the motivations or origins of its creator(s) remain a mystery.

**Addendum XXXX-1:** Incident Log 04/18/20██

During a scheduled test of SCP-XXXX's properties, Researcher Evans activated the music box within the containment chamber. At approximately 23 seconds into operation, an auditory distortion occurred, immediately triggering the site's containment alarm.

Researcher Evans reported a severe migraine headache and began vomiting uncontrollably. After 90 seconds of exposure, she lost consciousness and collapsed. Medical staff were able to stabilize Evans and transfer her to the site's Level 4 biohazard treatment facility.

Post-incident analysis of the audio and video recordings revealed no abnormalities prior to or after the distortion event. The seemingly ordinary musical notes produced a massive physiological reaction in Researcher Evans.

Following her recovery, Evans stated that the distorted notes sounded like "nails on a chalkboard, inside my skull." She has requested reassignment from SCP-XXXX research.

**Addendum XXXX-2:** Research Notes by Dr. Malhotra

The music box's unpredictable effects are unlike any other sonic or memetic hazard in our containment. Even seemingly innocuous tones can trigger an extreme psychosomatic response akin to resonance sickness.

My working theory is that SCP-XXXX's anomaly exists in a transdimensional state, bleeding through to our reality at random intervals and frequencies. This could explain the intensity of its biological impact - we may be perceiving just a sliver of a higher-dimensional phenomenon.

If this hypothesis is correct, it raises disturbing questions about SCP-XXXX's origins and capabilities. What kind of entity could wield such power over our physical perception of sound? And is the music box itself an intended conduit...or an unintended breach?

Clearly, more research is needed. But every second we spend studying this thing puts lives at risk. Perhaps discretion, not scientific curiosity, is the wiser choice.
