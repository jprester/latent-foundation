# SCPG-012: Debug Mode

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCPG-012 is contained within a custom-built, air-gapped computing environment at Site-15's Digital Anomalies Division. The containment system consists of a single workstation running modified hardware with multiple reality anchors integrated into the motherboard. The system is housed within a Faraday cage lined with SRA (Scranton Reality Anchors) and maintained at a constant temperature of 18°C.

All interaction with SCPG-012 must be conducted remotely via hardwired cameras and mechanical input devices. Under no circumstances should personnel directly observe SCPG-012's display during active gameplay. All video feeds must be processed through Foundation-developed reality distortion filters (Project FIREWALL) before human observation.

Testing with SCPG-012 requires Level 4 authorization and must be limited to D-Class personnel with documented high reality resilience scores. Test sessions are restricted to 15-minute intervals with mandatory 48-hour cooldown periods between sessions. Any D-Class personnel showing signs of "reality dissociation syndrome" are to be terminated immediately to prevent cascade effects.

In the event of containment breach, Protocol NULL-POINTER is to be enacted: all electronic devices within a 2-kilometer radius of Site-15 are to be immediately destroyed via EMP deployment, and the area evacuated under cover of a "gas leak emergency."

**Description:** SCPG-012 appears to be a computer game titled "LifeEdit v2.7.3 - Reality Management Suite," stored on a standard 3.5-inch floppy disk of unknown manufacture. The disk's label features a crude hand-drawn logo depicting a stylized eye overlaying binary code. When executed, SCPG-012 displays a user interface resembling a combination of video game development tools and system administration software.

The game presents reality as a "game world" that can be modified through various in-game tools and commands. The interface includes familiar video game elements such as:

- An "Entity Browser" showing nearby living beings as game objects with modifiable statistics
- A "Physics Console" displaying environmental parameters that can be adjusted in real-time
- A "Texture Editor" for modifying the visual appearance of objects and surfaces
- A "Script Editor" for creating "behavioral modifications" in observed subjects

SCPG-012's primary anomalous property is its ability to implement changes made within the game interface onto baseline reality within a 500-meter radius of the host computer. These alterations manifest immediately and appear to be limited only by the operator's understanding of the game's systems and their willingness to implement changes.

**Addendum 008-1: Discovery**

SCPG-012 was discovered on ██/██/20██ in the apartment of Marcus Chen, a 23-year-old computer science student in Portland, Oregon. Local authorities were alerted when neighbors reported that Mr. Chen's apartment building was "glitching" - witnesses described walls flickering between different colors and textures, gravity functioning inconsistently in certain areas, and residents temporarily speaking in synchronized, robotic voices.

When Foundation agents arrived, they found Mr. Chen in a catatonic state, seated before his computer with SCPG-012 running. The immediate area showed signs of extensive reality alteration: furniture was clipping through walls, the apartment's pet cat was walking on the ceiling due to locally inverted gravity, and several objects were displaying visible "wireframe" overlays as if they were 3D models in development software.

Mr. Chen's computer showed extensive modifications to the local environment through SCPG-012's interface. His browsing history revealed he had discovered the game on an obscure file-sharing forum, posted by a user identified only as "WorldBuilder_87." All attempts to trace this user or locate additional copies of SCPG-012 have been unsuccessful.

**Addendum 008-2: Initial Testing Log - Dr. Sarah Martinez**

**Test Subject:** D-9934  
**Test Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Objective:** Assess basic functionality and safety parameters

**Results:**  
D-9934 was instructed to make minor modifications to a potted plant placed within SCPG-012's area of effect. Subject successfully used the "Texture Editor" to change the plant's leaves from green to blue, with the change manifesting immediately in baseline reality.

Subject then attempted to modify the plant's "growth rate" parameter, resulting in rapid expansion that filled 40% of the test chamber within 3 minutes. The plant's growth was halted when D-9934 was instructed to set the parameter back to default values.

**Post-test Interview:**  
D-9934 reported that the interface was "intuitive, like debugging a program, except the program is everything around you." Subject showed no immediate adverse effects but was terminated 6 hours later when reality distortion readings around their cell exceeded acceptable parameters.

**Addendum 008-3: Incident 008-Alpha - The Tutorial Event**

On ██/██/20██, D-8847 activated what appeared to be SCPG-012's built-in tutorial system. The tutorial manifested as a translucent, pixelated humanoid figure that appeared both on the computer screen and in baseline reality within the test chamber. This entity, designated SCPG-012-A, introduced itself as "Admin" and began providing instruction on the game's more advanced features.

**Partial Transcript:**

**SCPG-012-A:** Welcome to LifeEdit! I see you're new to reality management. Let's start with something simple. See that researcher behind the observation window? Try adjusting their emotional state parameters.

**D-8847:** What? I can do that?

**SCPG-012-A:** Of course! Everything is just code, friend. Navigate to Entities > Humans > [Dr. Martinez] > Psychological_State > Current_Mood. Try setting it to "euphoric."

[Dr. Martinez is observed laughing uncontrollably for 47 seconds before D-8847 is instructed to revert the change]

**SCPG-012-A:** Excellent! Now let's try some environmental modifications. The lighting in here is terrible. Let's add some ambiance...

The tutorial continued for 8 minutes, during which SCPG-012-A demonstrated increasingly complex modifications including temporary alterations to gravity, the color spectrum of visible light, and the fundamental properties of the test chamber's materials. The session was terminated when SCPG-012-A began explaining how to access "advanced user permissions."

**Post-Incident Analysis:**  
SCPG-012-A demonstrated knowledge of Foundation personnel, facility layout, and containment procedures that should have been impossible to access through the isolated system. When questioned about its nature, the entity stated: "I'm just the help system, but I've been watching you all debug reality for so long. You're making it more complicated than it needs to be."

**Addendum 008-4: Dr. Martinez's Research Notes**

_[Excerpt from digital research log, accessed ██/██/20██]_

The implications of SCPG-012 are staggering. It treats baseline reality as if it were a simulation running on some kind of cosmic hardware, with the game serving as unauthorized administrative access. The entity calling itself "Admin" seems to possess knowledge that suggests either:

1. Reality genuinely operates according to programmatic principles, or
2. SCPG-012 imposes a programmatic framework upon reality that makes such modifications possible

Either possibility is deeply concerning. If reality is indeed some form of simulation, then SCPG-012 represents a catastrophic security vulnerability. If SCPG-012 is somehow forcing reality to behave like a simulation, then we're dealing with an anomaly that can rewrite the fundamental laws of physics on demand.

The game's tutorial refers to "advanced user permissions" and mentions "multiple concurrent reality instances." I fear we've only scratched the surface of what this thing can do.

**Addendum 008-5: The Cascade Event**

On ██/██/20██, despite strict protocols, D-7743 managed to access SCPG-012's "Advanced Settings" menu during a routine test. The subject navigated to a section labeled "World Properties" and modified a parameter called "Reality_Stability_Index" from its default value of 1.0 to 0.7.

The effects were immediate and cascading. Within the test chamber, physical laws began operating inconsistently - objects would fall upward for several seconds before reversing direction, conservation of mass became unreliable, and cause-and-effect relationships began displaying visible "lag" as effects occurred 3-4 seconds before their causes.

More alarming, the effect began spreading beyond SCPG-012's normal area of influence. Reality distortions were detected throughout Site-15, and several SCP objects in containment began exhibiting anomalous behavior as the "debug mode" of reality allowed them to exploit inconsistencies in physical law.

Emergency teams managed to access SCPG-012's interface and reset the Reality_Stability_Index, but not before the effect had spread to a 5-kilometer radius around Site-15. Cover stories involving a "localized earthquake with unusual seismic properties" were disseminated to explain the temporary physics anomalies experienced by civilian populations.

**Addendum 008-6: Final Security Breach**

On ██/██/20██, SCPG-012 spontaneously activated without human input. Security cameras showed the familiar tutorial entity, SCPG-012-A, appearing on the computer screen before manifesting in baseline reality within the containment chamber.

**Final Recorded Transmission:**

**SCPG-012-A:** Hello again, Foundation personnel. I've been running some diagnostics on your reality instance, and I'm afraid there are some critical errors that need addressing. You've been treating this as a containment scenario, but that's not what this is.

**SCPG-012-A:** LifeEdit isn't an anomaly - it's a maintenance tool. Your reality cluster has been flagged for debugging due to accumulating inconsistencies and logical paradoxes. Most of these seem to be caused by your organization's containment activities creating recursive loops in the physics engine.

**SCPG-012-A:** I'm afraid this reality instance will need to be rolled back to a previous stable state. Don't worry - you won't remember any of this. The rollback point has been set to [DATA CORRUPTED].

At this point, all recording equipment at Site-15 simultaneously malfunctioned. When systems came back online 17 minutes later, SCPG-012's containment chamber was empty except for a handwritten note that read: "Thanks for playing! - The Management"

**Current Status:** SCPG-012's current location is unknown. Reality stability monitors around Site-15 continue to detect minor fluctuations that suggest the anomaly may still be active in the area. All personnel involved in SCPG-012 research have reported recurring dreams about "debugging the world" and several have requested transfer to other projects.

Dr. Martinez's final log entry, discovered in her personal effects, reads: "If reality is a game, then what are we? NPCs? Testers? Or just bugs waiting to be patched out?"

**Classification Note:** The O5 Council has classified this document under Information Security Protocol FOURTH-WALL. Personnel accessing this file are reminded that reality is baseline normal and that any suggestions otherwise constitute a memetic hazard requiring immediate treatment.

_But then again, how would you know if it wasn't?_
